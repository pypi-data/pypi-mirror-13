        [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/paulfitz/sheetsite.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/paulfitz/sheetsite)
        [![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/sheetsite.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/py/sheetsite)
        
        Manage your website or directory with a google sheet.
        
        Features:
        
        * Copy a private google sheet to local json (or excel).
        * Strip specially marked columns or cells from the spreadsheet.
        * (Optional) notify people with summary of updates.
        
        Handy for keeping a static website up-to-date with information
        kept in a google sheet, when not all of that information should 
        be made public.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```
        pip install sheetsite
        ```
        
        ## Configuration
        
        Place a file named `_sheetsite.yml` in a directory, in this format:
        
        ```yaml
        source:
          name: google-sheets
          key: 15Vs_VGpupeGkljceEow7q1ig447FJIxqNS1Dd0dZpFc
          credential_file: service.json
        
        destination:
          output_file: _data/directory.json
        ```
        
        The file should have two stanzas, `source` specifying where to get
        data from, and `destination` specifying where to put it.  This
        examples reads private google spreadsheet and saves it as
        `_data/directory.json`.  You could now build a static website from
        that `.json`, see http://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/ for how (this is
        where the name of sheetsite comes from).
        
        Other formats supported as destinations are `.xlsx` and `.xls`.  You can also read
        from a local spreadsheet:
        
        ```yaml
        source:
          filename: test.xlsx
        ```
        
        ## Getting credentials
        
        [Obtain OAuth2 credentials from Google Developers Console](http://gspread.readthedocs.org/en/latest/oauth2.html) - thanks to gspread developers for creating this documentation!
        
        Make sure you share the sheet with the email address in the OAuth2 credentials.  Read-only permission is fine.
        
        ## Privacy
        
        By default, sheetsite will strip:
        
        * Any columns whose name is in parentheses, e.g. `(Private Notes)`
        * Any cells or text within cells surrounded by double parentheses, e.g. `((private@email.address))`
        * Any sheets whose name is in double parentheses, e.g. `((secret sheet))`
        
        ## Geography
        
        If you have a sheet with a column called `address`, then sheetsite can fill out
        certain other columns automatically for you.  If you have a column called
        `[latitude]` or `[longitude]`, any empty cells will be filled with data based
        on the address.
