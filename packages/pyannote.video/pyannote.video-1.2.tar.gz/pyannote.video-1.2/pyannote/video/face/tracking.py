    Parameters
    ----------

        Kill trackers whose confidence goes below this value. Defaults to 10.
    min_overlap_ratio : float, optional
        Do not associate trackers and detections if their overlap ratio goes
        below this value. Defaults to 0.3.
    max_gap : float, optional
        Bridge gaps with duration shorter than this value.
