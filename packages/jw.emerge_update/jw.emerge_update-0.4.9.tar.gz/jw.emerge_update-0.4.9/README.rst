=============
emerge_update
=============

This is a script for package update and general system management in Gentoo's portage package manager. The aim is to
automate system updating and maintenance as straight forward as possible. There are a lot of commands to be run to
keep a Gentoo Linux system healthy and tidy. Emerge alone does not do a lot. That's where this script comes in.

What does emerge_update do?
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The following tasks are run:

#.  Run ``qcheck --badonly --all`` to check for altered files belonging to packages installed with emerge. With a few
    exceptions no files should be modified. This is a simple way to detect malicious activities e.g. by an intruder.[1]

#.  Run ``eix-sync -q`` to update the package repository

#.  Backup `/etc` (see Backups_)

#.  Run ``emerge @world``. A lot of options are given, see `Emerge Options`_

#.  If emerge returns with a non-zero status, the assumption is made that some packages required some changes in the files
    in `/etc/portage`. In this case, ``etc-update --automode=-5 /etc/portage`` is run to make the changes proposed by `emerge`
    permanent. Then, ``emerge @world`` is run again. Of course, if `emerge` fails because of some non-trivial problem this
    needlessly re-runs `emerge` a second time without effect.

#.  Run ``emerge --depclean`` to remove unnecessary packages

#.  Run ``revdep-rebuild --ignore`` to rebuild packages with broken shared library dependencies due to the last `emerge`.

#.  Run ``emerge @preserved-rebuild``. Another measure to repair broken library dependencies. Gentoo recommends running
    both `revdep-rebuild` and `@preserved-rebuild`.

#.  Run ``python-updater``

#.  Run ``perl-cleaner --all``

#.  Run ``cfg-update --update --automatic-only`` to update all config files which can be updated automatically.

#.  Run ``cfg-update --index`` to create update indexes for the next run of `cfg-update`.

#.  Run ``prelink --all`` to prelink all binaries to speed up loading them.

#.  Backup `/var/db/pkg` (see Backups_). If this directory is destroyed, you are in *the most serious trouble*.

#.  Run ``qcheck --all --update`` to bring the checksums up-to-date for the next run.

#.  Run ``emaint -c all`` to check for potential problems or points for improvement. This does not repair anything. You can run
    ``emaint -f ...`` eg. ``emaint -f all`` to fix things.

Using emerge_update
"""""""""""""""""""

Options
'''''''

-h, --help                  show the help
--dry-run, -n               don't execute commands, just print them
--verbose, -v               print commands as they are executed
--version, -V               show program's version number and exit
--output OUTPUT, -o OUTPUT  specify output file
--append, -a                append to output file instead of overwriting

To test the script, run it with ``emerge_update --dry-run``. This way, it only shows what would be done.

.. Tip::

   Run the script with ``--verbose --output /var/log/emerge_update --append`` to have a nice log of what's going on.

.. Tip::

   Run the script with ``nice -19`` and ``ionice -c3`` in order to not put the system under too much load.

Backups
"""""""

Backups are done by renaming and hard-linking the target ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.listif possible. This
does not work with mount points, however. Directories acting as a mount point are backed up as a tar file into a
backup directory ( `/var/lib/emerge_update` by default). The backup directory is created if necessary.

.. note::

   You should maintain the backup directory (usually `/var/lib/emerge_update`) by deleting old backups. You can do
   this with package `tmpwatch`. The move-and-link backups retain 8 generations.

Emerge Options
""""""""""""""

Emerge is run with these options:

--nospinner
    This is not desirable in automated runs of emerge

--update
    Only update packages

--newuse
    Update packages when the USE configuration changes

--deep
    Consider updating dependencies

--keep-going
    Continue in case of error to update as much as possible

--autounmask y
    Unmask required packages

--autounmask-write y
    Make unmasking permanent

--jobs n
    where ``n`` = 4. This runs a maximum of 4 parallel emerge jobs

--load-average n
    where ``n`` is the number of processors on-line in the system or `3` if this number cannot be determined.

    This prevents creating new emerge jobs if the load average if above `n`
