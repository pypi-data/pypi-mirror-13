        Coral is a library for encoding the process of designing synthetic DNA
        constructs. Coral mirrors the traditional design steps used in GUI-based
        sequence design (ApE, j5, Benchling, etc.) as operations on data structures,
        enables iterative design through analysis modules, and connects seamlessly to
        outside libraries. Through the use of Coral, you can translate your DNA design
        processes into concise, executable, and reusable scripts.
        
        Coral encodes synthetic DNA design rules into its core sequence data types
        (DNA, RNA, and Peptide), enabling concise, dependable methods for automated
        DNA design.
        
        Coral works with PyPy so long as a PyPy-compatible numpy is installed.
