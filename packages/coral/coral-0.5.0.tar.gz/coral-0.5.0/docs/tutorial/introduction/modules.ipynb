You can explore the functions and classes defined for each module by reading more of the ipython documentation, sphinx autodoc documentation, or interactively investigating modules in the ipython notebook using tab completion and ? documentation. coral follows the PEP 8 style guidelines on class and function names so that you can differentiate between them - classes use CamelCase and functions use lower_case with underscores."
