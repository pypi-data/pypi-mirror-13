C++ port (with enhancements) of the PyMca Physics routines.

This library allows to calculate the expected X-ray fluorescence intensities measured by a detection system.

Account for scondary excitation is made via the reference:

D.K.G. de Boer, X-Ray Spectrometry 19 (1990) 145-154

with the correction mentioned in:

D.K.G. de Boer et al, X-Ray Spectrometry 22 (1993) 33-28

Tertiary excitation is accounted for with an appproximation.

The accuracy of the corrections has been tested against experimental data and Monte Carlo simulations.
