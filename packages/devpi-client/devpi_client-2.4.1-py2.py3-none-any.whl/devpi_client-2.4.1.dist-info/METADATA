devpi-client: commands for python packaging and testing
===============================================================

The "devpi" command line tool is typically used in conjunction
with `devpi-server <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/devpi-server>`_.
It allows to upload, test and install packages from devpi indexes.
See http://doc.devpi.net for quickstart and more documentation.

Changelog
=========

2.4.1 (2016-2-1)
------------------

- fix issue308: properly handle index reconfiguration in the client API.
  thanks to Jacob Geiger for the report and an initial PR.

2.4.0 (2016-1-29)
------------------

- fix issue291: transfer file modes with vcs exports.  Thanks Sergey
  Vasilyev for the report.

- new option "--index" for "install", "list", "push", "remove", "upload" and
  "test" which allows to use a different than the current index without using
  "devpi use" before

- set ``index`` in ``[search]`` section of ``pip.cfg`` when writing cfgs, to
  support ``pip search``


2.3.2 (2015-11-11)
------------------

- fix git submodules for devpi upload. ``.git`` is a file not a folder for
  submodules. Before this fix the repository which contains the submodule was
  found instead, which caused a failure, because the files aren't tracked there.

- new option "devpi upload --setupdir-only" which will only
  vcs-export the directory containing setup.py. You can also
  set "setupdirs-only = 1" in the "[devpi:upload]" section
  of setup.cfg for the same effect.  Thanks Chad Wagner for the PR.


2.3.1 (2015-09-10)
------------------

- fix issue259: print server errors in client


2.3.0 (2015-07-09)
------------------

- fix issue247: possible password leakage to log in devpi-client

- new experimental "-d|--detox" option to run tests via the "detox" distributed testing
  tool instead of "tox" which runs test environments one by one.

- address issue246: make sure we use vcs-export also for building docs (and
  respect --no-vcs for all building activity)

- address issue246: copy VCS repo dir to temporary upload dir to help
  with setuptools_scm. Warn if VCS other than hg/git are used because
  we don't copy the repo in that case for now and thus cause incompatibility
  with setuptools_scm.

- (new,experimental) read a "[devpi:upload]" section from a setup.cfg file
  with a "formats" setting that will be taken if no "--formats" option
  is specified to "devpi upload".  This allows to specify the default
  artefacts that should be created along with a project's setup.cfg file.
  Also you can use a ``no-vcs = True`` setting to induce the ``--no-vcs``
  option.
