The Go CD Pipeline Builder is designed to have the same function in the Go CD ecology, as the Jenkins Job Builder has in the Jenkins ecology. Given a (git) repository and appropriate configuration, it should be able to add a suitable pipeline to a Go-server. The current version does not trigger on git events. It is simply a command line driven tool.
