-------
``angora`` is released on PyPI, so all you need is:

.. code-block:: console

	$ pip install angora

To upgrade to latest version:

.. code-block:: console
	
	$ pip install --upgrade angora

``angora`` doesn't force user to install all pre-requisite third party packages. You can install it when you see the error message and when you need it.
