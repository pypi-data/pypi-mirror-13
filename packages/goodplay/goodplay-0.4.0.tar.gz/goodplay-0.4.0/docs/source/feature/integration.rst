Integrating with Third Parties
==============================

Travis CI
---------

`Travis CI`_ is a continuous integration service that is available
to open source projects at no cost.

.. code-block:: yaml

   # .travis.yml
   sudo: required

   language: python
   python: 2.7

   services:
     - docker

   install:
     - pip install goodplay

   script:
     - goodplay -v

.. _`Travis CI`: https://travis-ci.org/


Jenkins CI
----------

To run on `Jenkins CI`_ you have to configure the following in your build job:

#. Under section **Build** choose **Add build step > Execute shell** with

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip install goodplay
      goodplay -v --junit-xml=junit.xml

#. Under section **Post-build Actions** choose
   **Add post-build action > Publish JUnit test result report** and set
   **Test report XMLs** to ``**/junit.xml``.

pytest
------

goodplay is built as a pytest_ plugin which is enabled by default.
Thus when running your other tests via ``py.test`` command line interface,
pytest also runs the goodplay tests right beside them.

.. note::

   When running ``goodplay`` command line interface only goodplay tests
   are considered.
