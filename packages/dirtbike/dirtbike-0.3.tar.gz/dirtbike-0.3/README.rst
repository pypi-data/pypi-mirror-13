Purpose of the software
=======================

This is a Python program that takes packages that are already installed on a
system and converts them to
`wheels <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0427/>`__.

That is an admittedly strange goal. The deeper purpose is to help Debian
packages like `pip` vendor their dependencies in a way compatible with the
packaging policy for Debian, and hopefully other GNU/Linux distributions.

Therefore, we am eager to see this tool discussed and/or adopted by Fedora,
Debian, Ubuntu, and any other software distributions that distribute pip as
well as other Python packages.

Origin of the name
==================

The name comes from a They Might Be Giants song::

  Here comes the dirt bike,
  Beware of the dirt bike.
  [...]
  You see I never thought I'd understand.
  Till that bike took me by the hand,
  Now I ride.

The real motivation behind the name was to find a word or two that
alludes to the idea of "wheel."

"Boat of Car" might have been too confusing.
