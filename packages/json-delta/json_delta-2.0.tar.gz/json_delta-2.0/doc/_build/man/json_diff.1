.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fIjson_diff\fP produces deltas between JSON\-serialized data structures.
If no arguments are specified, stdin will be expected to be a JSON
array \fB[left, right]\fP, and the output will be written to stdout.
.sp
The default output is itself a JSON data structure, specifically an
array of arrays of the form \fB[<keypath>]\fP or \fB[<keypath>,
<replacement>]\fP\&. The companion program \fIjson_patch(1)\fP can
be used to apply such a diff.
.sp
A keypath is an array of string or integer tokens specifying a
path to a terminal node in the data structure.  For example, in the
structure \fB[{}, {"foo": "bar"}]\fP, the string \fB"bar"\fP appears at
the node addressed by the key sequence \fB[1, \(aqfoo\(aq]\fP, and the empty
object \fB{}\fP appears at key sequence \fB[0]\fP\&.
.sp
If a diff stanza is an array of length 1, consisting only of a key
sequence, \fIjson_patch(1)\fP interprets it as an instruction to
delete the node the key sequence points to.  If a stanza is of length
2, the node is replaced by the last element of the stanza.
.sp
An alternative output format for \fIjson_diff\fP is accessed using the
\fI\-\-unified\fP / \fI\-u\fP option.  This is designed to be
more legible to the human eye, inspired by unified diffs as output by
\fIdiff(1)\fP\&. \fIjson_patch(1)\fP can read
either format, and, since there is enough information in the format,
can apply \fI\-\-unified\fP patches in reverse.
.sp
\fIjson_diff\fP will accept input in any of the encodings specified in RFC
7159, namely UTF\-8, \-16 or \-32, with or without byte\-order marks.
Note that the output is always encoded as UTF\-8.
