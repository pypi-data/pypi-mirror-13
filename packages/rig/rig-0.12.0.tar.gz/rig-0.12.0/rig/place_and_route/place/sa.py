    This placement algorithm uses simulated annealing directly on the supplied

    indirectly, the potential for congestion). Though computationally
    expensive, this placer produces relatively good placement solutions.

    The annealing temperature schedule used by this algorithm is taken from
    "VPR: A New Packing, Placement and Routing Tool for FPGA Research" by
    Vaughn Betz and Jonathan Rose from the "1997 International Workshop on
    Field Programmable Logic and Applications".

    This algorithm is written in pure Python and is not highly optimised for
    performance.

    This algorithm produces INFO level logging information describing the
    progress made by the algorithm.

    .. warning:
        This algorithm does not attempt to produce good solutions to the
        bin-packing problem of optimally fitting vertices into chips and it may
        fail if a good placement requires good bin packing.

        A scaling factor for the number of iterations the algorithm should run
        for. 1.0 is probably about as low as you'll want to go in practice and
        runtime increases linearly as you increase this parameter.
    random : :py:class:`random.Random`
        A Python random number generator. Defaults to ``import random`` but can
        be set to your own instance of :py:class:`random.Random` to allow you
        to control the seed and produce deterministic results. For results to
        be deterministic, vertices_resources must be supplied as an
        :py:class:`collections.OrderedDict`.
    on_temperature_change : callback_function or None
        An (optional) callback function which is called every time the
        temperature is changed. This callback can be used to provide status
        updates

        The callback function is passed the following arguments:

        * ``iteration_count``: the number of iterations the placer has
          attempted (integer)
        * ``placements``: The current placement solution.
        * ``cost``: the weighted sum over all nets of bounding-box size.
          (float)
        * ``acceptance_rate``: the proportion of iterations which have resulted
          in an accepted change since the last callback call. (float between
          0.0 and 1.0)
        * ``temperature``: The current annealing temperature. (float)
        * ``distance_limit``: The maximum distance any swap may be made over.
          (integer)

        If the callback returns False, the anneal is terminated immediately and
        the current solution is returned.
