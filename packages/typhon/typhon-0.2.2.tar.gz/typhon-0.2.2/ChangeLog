	* doc/Makefile: Add target to upload docs for my own convenience.

2016-02-16  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* doc/requirements.rtd: Removed again. The automatic build
	of the documentation through the readthedocs.org service fails if
	additional packages such as netCDF4 are required. Although packages can
	be set as requirements for the build, the pip install in their
	virtualenv fails in this case due to lack of HDF5. Similar problems
	will most likely occur later for other packages (e.g. basemap).

	This makes the readthedocs service useless for our purposes. The typhon
	docs have moved with immediate effect to

	http://www.radiativetransfer.org/misc/typhon/doc/

	instead. That gives us much more flexibility. The rtd project has been
	removed.
