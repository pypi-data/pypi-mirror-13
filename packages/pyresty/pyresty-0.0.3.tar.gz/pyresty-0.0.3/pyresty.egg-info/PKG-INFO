Description: #pyresty
        
        `pyresty` is a requests wrapper inspired by [micha/resty](http://github.com/micha/resty). It provides a simple, concice shell interface for interacting with REST
        services. 
        
        ##Quick Start
        
        Install pyresty however you desire. I recommend `pip`.
        
        ```
        $ pip install pyresty
        ```
        
        Add a host to the configuration (ad-hoc hosts to be added soon):
        
        ```
        $ pyresty add localhost http://localhost:8000/v2.0
        ```
        
        Set the global host to your target:
        
        ```
        $ pyresty localhost
        ```
        
        Make requests:
        
        ```
        $ GET /things
        {[{"id": 1, "name": "superwidget"}, {"id": 2, "name": "not_cool_widget"}]}
        
        $ DELETE /things/1
        ```
        
        Switch hosts if you want:
        
        ```
        $ pyresty production_server
        ```
        
        ##Upcoming Features:
        
        * ad-hoc host definition: `pyresty http://random.com`
        * session recording and playback
        * token loading from environment
        * auth plugins
        * host sections with more options
        * output options
        * vi integration
