WXTextView
==========

Wxtextview is widget for the wx toolkit and is written completely in
python. It has the functionality of a rich text editor and can handle
even very long texts without beeing slow. All layout and editor logic
is implemented in python. Only basic drawing commands are used from
the wx toolkit. It is therefore easy to adapt it to other
GUI-toolkits.

There are two demos showing advanced possibilities of WXTextView:

:notebook.py:

 A notebook interface similar to mathematica / ipython

:math_demo.py:
 
 A demonstration of editing math equations


1. USAGE
========


Running the demos:
------------------

Just cd to the demo directory and execute the scripts. No installation
is needed. External dependencies are `textmodel
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/textmodel>`_ (all demos), wxpython (all
demos) and matplotlib (notebook). The demos were tested on linux,
windows and mac platforms.

::

    $ cd demo/
    $ python demo1.py


Using the wxtextview-widget:
----------------------------

::

    from wxtextview import WXTextView
    from textmodel import TextModel

    import wx
    app = wx.App()


    model = TextModel(u'Hello World!')
    model.set_properties(6, 11, fontsize=14)
    model.set_properties(6, 11, bgcolor='yellow')

    # display the texmodel in a view 
    frame = wx.Frame(None)
    view = WXTextView(frame, -1)
    view.model = model
    frame.Show()

    # set cursor and selection
    view.index = 5
    view.selection = 0, 5

    # display the same textmodel in a second view
    frame2 = wx.Frame(None)
    view2 = WXTextView(frame2, -1)
    view2.model = model
    frame2.Show()

    app.MainLoop()
