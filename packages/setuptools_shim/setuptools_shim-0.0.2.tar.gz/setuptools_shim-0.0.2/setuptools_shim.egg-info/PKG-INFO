        Abstract build system shim providing setup.py
        
        This repository provides a shim so that projects using non-setuptools build
        systems which can be built using the PEP XX [#pepxx] abstract build interface,
        can be installed by older pip versions which do not implement the interface.

        Usage
        -----
        
        1. Copy ``shim.py`` from this project into your source tree as
           ``setup.py``
        
        Once this is done, calling ``setup.py`` will trigger easy-install to make
        ``setuptools_shim`` and its dependencies as well as the bootstrap requirements
        from ``pypa.json`` available at build/install time.
