        .. note::
        
            This module can be imported in python with the name ``django_backend``. The
            PyPI package is called `django-admin-backend`_ though. We had to use a
            different name as ``django-backend`` was already registered on PyPI. It's a
            little unfortunate this way, but a necessary workaround for now.

        Installation
        ============
        
        Add the following apps to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` settings:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                ...
                'django.contrib.auth',
                'django.contrib.sites',
                'django.contrib.staticfiles',
                ...
                'django_backend',
                'floppyforms',
            )
        
        Make sure ``SITE_ID`` is set:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            SITE_ID = 1
        
        Make sure ``LANGUAGE_CODE`` is valid:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            LANGUAGE_CODE = 'en'
        
        **Warning:** Django's default language code is *not* valid, as "en-us" is not included in settings.LANGUAGES.
        
        Add the following line to your ``urls.py``:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            url(r'^backend/', include(django_backend.site.get_urls(), namespace='django_backend')),
        
        TODO: continue, propably not complete yet
        
        Development
        ===========
        
        Run tests
        ---------
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            # Set everything up. You want to do this in a virtualenv.
            pip install -r tests/requirements.txt
            python setup.py develop
        
            # Run the tests. Should be executed in the root of the project.
            py.test

            :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-admin-backend
        
        Build static assets
        -------------------
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            npm install
            gulp build
        
            # Use gulp watch to continuously build on source file changes.
            gulp watch
        
        Or to create a development build that includes source maps, execute the ``dev`` task first, like:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            gulp dev build
        
        
        0.4.0
        -----
        
        - Fix ``GenericRelationListField``. It's internal API was not used correctly
          and therfore just threw errors.
        
        - Allow ``SelectRelatedField`` to pick up inline backends, searching from
          currently active backend. That makes it easier to use customized nested
          inline backends.
        
        0.3.0
        -----
        
        * Adjusted multiple imports:
        
          - Forms, formfields and widgets should be now always imported from
            ``django_backend.forms``. Example::
        
            # OLD import, will no longer work
            from django_backend.backend.base.formfields import SelectRelatedField
        
            # NEW import
            from django_backend.forms import SelectRelatedField
        
        * Add ``ManageRelatedField`` that can inline a list page of a related model
          in the change view.
        
        * Add ``GenericRelationListField`` that can show a reorderable list related
          by a intermediary model with a generic foreign key.
        
        * Use Django's app config to make autoloading of backends predictable.
        
        * Ensuring support for Django 1.6 and 1.8.
        
        * Integrating bootstrap styles for floppyforms widgets.
        
        * Disable caching for backend views.
        
        * Allow subclasses of ``FilterForm`` to define ``filter_queryset_{field_name}``
          methods for easy extendability.
        
        0.1.0
        -----
        
        * Initial release.
