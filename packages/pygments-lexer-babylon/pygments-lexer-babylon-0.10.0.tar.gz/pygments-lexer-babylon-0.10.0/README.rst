pygments-lexer-babylon
======================

A javascript lexer for Pygments that uses the babylon parser

WARNING!
--------

``Node.js`` must be installed to use this package and must be available
as ``nodejs``. If the following command works, you are most probably OK:

::

    nodejs -v

Why?
----

Pygments can not properly highlight new and shiny ``javascript``
(particulary ``jsx``). Until all these features are implemented in
Pygments, you can use this package as a fallback. Also, it is a good fun
to experiment with various technologies :wink:.

Install
-------

Nothing too much here, apart from the ``Node.js`` dependency:

::

    pip install pygments-lexer-babylon

This will install ``Pygments`` for you (>=2.0), so if something depends
on an older version, ``virtualenv`` is recommended. (Or use
``docker``...)

Usage
-----

The importable name of the package: ``pygmentslexerbabylon``. It
provides two lexers: ``BabylonLexer`` and ``BabylonHtmlLexer``. The
latter is needed because the built in ``HtmlLexer`` hard codes the usage
of ``JavascriptLexer`` between ``<script>`` tags.

If you have "manual" control over which lexer to use, do something like
this:

.. code:: python

    from pygments import highlight
    from pygments.formatters import HtmlFormatter
    from pygmentslexerbabylon import BabylonLexer

    lexer = BabylonLexer()  # You select it manually...
    formatter = HtmlFormatter(linenos=True, cssclass="source")
    code = '<ReactComponent/>'
    result = highlight(code, lexer, formatter)

In some cases you do not have control over the selected lexer. Let's
say, you use Markdown, which turns out to use code like this:

.. code:: python

    from pygments.lexers import get_lexer_by_name, guess_lexer

    try:
        lexer = get_lexer_by_name(self.lang)
    except ValueError:
        try:
            lexer = guess_lexer(self.src)
        except ValueError:
            lexer = get_lexer_by_name('text')

In this case use language name ``jsx`` for javascript files and
``htmlx`` for html files.

If you use the ``pygmentize`` all the above works:

.. code:: sh

    $ pygmentize -l jsx myreact.js  # Note the extension is not jsx
    $ pygmentize myreact.jsx
    $ pygmentize -l htmlx htmlwithjsx.html
    $ pygmentize htmlwithjsx.htmlx

Gotchas
-------

-  It is a bit slower than ``Pygments``...
-  May fail for really large files (0.5 MB worked for me though)
-  Produces slightly different result than the original ``Pygments``
   lexer
