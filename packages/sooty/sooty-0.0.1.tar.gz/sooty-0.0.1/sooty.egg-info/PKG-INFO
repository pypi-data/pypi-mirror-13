Description: Sooty: Simple Database Migrator
        ========================
        
        Sooty is a simple database migration tool for postgres databases. When working with a legacy application, more often than not, the application has no means of migrating the database forward. This is a simple library to bridge that gap.
        
        The name Sooty comes from the bird Sooty Shearwater which can travel over 20,000 miles during it's annual migration. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sooty_shearwater
        
        Usage
        ------------
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            sooty create add index on product ids
        
            $ Created directory './migrations'
            $ Created migration file './migrations/create_index_on_product_ids_20160218223012.sql
        
            $ cat ./migrations/create_index_on_product_ids_20160218223012.sql
            
            -- Just type some SQL!
            -- ALTER TABLE products ADD COLUMN customer_code varchar(11)
            
        
        
        To run your migrations just
        
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            $ sooty run <database_url>
        
        
        If no database url is provided, sooty will try to use the environment variable DATABASE_URL
        
        
        
        That's it!
