"""Scat2Angle
***********************

Scat2Angle is a python wrapper for the C++ executable compiled from getAngles.cpp. 
This uses some of the functions in the NonLinLoc code (specifically GridLib and it's dependencies)
to convert the location PDF scatter samples into take-off angle samples for all stations. 

To compile the executable, it is necesary to compile some other components into object code. For an example, please see the make_angles.sh file, or the README

The input control file is very simple - A two line file::
    
    path/to/nonlinloc/time/gridfiles
    path/to/nonlinloc/loc/scatfiles

The paths can have the beginning of the file name as well
e.g. ~/mynlloc/time/grid

where the grid files are in ~/mynlloc/time and begin with e.g. grid.***** for the P phases. The same applies for the location .scat files.

There is an optional third line which sets the phase to use (i.e. P or S), where the default is P.



Command line flags
*********************************
To obtain a list of the command line flags use the -h flag::

    $~ Scat2Angle -h

This will provide a list of the arguments and their usage.


Running from the command line
*********************************
To run from the command line on  linux/*nix  it is necessary to make sure that the Scat2Angle script installed is on the path,
or to set up a manual alias/script, e.g. for bash::

    python -c "import Scat2Angle;Scat2Angle.__run__()" $*


On windows (Requires NLLoc programs to be installed on windows too) using powershell add the following commandlet to your profile (for information on customizing your powershell profile see: http://www.howtogeek.com/50236/customizing-your-powershell-profile/)::

    function Scat2Angle{
        $script={
            python -c "import Scat2Angle;Scat2Angle.__run__()" $args
        }
        Invoke-Command -ScriptBlock $script -ArgumentList $args
    }



Running from within python
*********************************
To run from within python, (assuming the module is on your PYTHONPATH)::

    >>import Scat2Angle
    >>Scat2Angle.__run__()

This will run with the default options, although these can be customized - see the Scat2Angle.__run__ docstrings.
 
Output file
*********************************

The output format for the scatangle file is:

            Probability
            StationName Azimuth TakeOffAngle
            StationName Azimuth TakeOffAngle
