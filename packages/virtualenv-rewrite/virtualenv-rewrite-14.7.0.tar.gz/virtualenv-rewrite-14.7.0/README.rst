virtualenv
==========

This is based on the `rewrite` branch of virtualenv: https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/tree/rewrite

What pythons are currently supported in this fork:

* Python 2.6
* PyPy
* PyPy3 (on Windows it doesn't really work cause
  `pip is broken on the 2.4.0 release <https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/issue/1696/can-not-install-pip-with-get-pippy>`_)
* Python 2.6
* Python 2.7
* Python 3.2 (tested but unsupported, check test results for exact situation)
* Python 3.3
* Python 3.4

What's currently tested (on Windows |appveyor| and Linux |circleci| |travis|):

* creation
* recreation
* ``--system-site-packages`` (incl. ordering of sites)
* ``.pth`` support
* bin scripts
* tox integration
* C extensions compile properly inside

Debian-flavored linuxes are also supported (with their messy patches on site.py/distutils/sysconfig).

What's missing:

* No symlinks or hardlinks, just dumb copies.
* Relocation support (it wasn't really supported in legacy virtualenv anyway).
* You tell me ...
