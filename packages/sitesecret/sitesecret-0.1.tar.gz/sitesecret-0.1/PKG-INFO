Description: Sitesecret is a tiny library to generate and store per-site secrets.
        
        Stop doing this::
        
            SECRET = 'my-top-sekrit-key'
        
        
        And do this instead::
        
            import sitesecret
        
            SECRET = sitesecret.get_secret(__name__)
        
        
        ``SECRET`` will be initialized with 1024 octets of random data, suitable for
        cryptographic applications. The data will be saved in the current directory in
        a file named ``.sitesecret-<module name>``.
        
        Subsequent calls will return the same secret value and sitesecret ensures
        that only a single secret is ever generated â€” even if multiple processes call
        ``get_secret`` at the same time .
