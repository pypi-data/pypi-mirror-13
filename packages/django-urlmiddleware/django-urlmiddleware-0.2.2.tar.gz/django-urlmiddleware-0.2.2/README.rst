Django urlmiddleware
========================================

Django urlmiddleware allows you to define middleware in your Django project 
with a URL based configuration, like views. This then allows you to enable 
middleware for specific paths rather than only globally for all requests.

See http://urlmiddleware.readthedocs.org/ for further documentation.
