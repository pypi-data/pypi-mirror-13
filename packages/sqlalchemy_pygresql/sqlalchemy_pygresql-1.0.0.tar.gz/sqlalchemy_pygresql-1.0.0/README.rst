sqlalchemy-pygresql
===================
This project provides a SQLAlchemy dialect for the PyGreSQL driver. This is not
a well-supported dialect, but it is hoped that it will fill some people's needs.
You may also want to check out the pg8000 or Psycopg dialects, which are much
better supported.

Usage
-----

Driver is 'postgresql+pygresql'; use URLs as standard for postgresql.

Requirements
------------
The following software is required to use the PyGreSQL dialect for SQLAlchemy:

* PyGreSQL 4.2
* Python 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, or 3.4
* SQLAlchemy version 0.8.0 or higher
