        python-paycoinrpc
        =================
        
        AuthServiceProxy is an improved version of python-jsonrpc.
        
        It includes the following generic improvements:
        
        * HTTP connections persist for the life of the AuthServiceProxy object
        * sends protocol 'version', per JSON-RPC 1.1
        * sends proper, incrementing 'id'
        * uses standard Python json lib
        
        It also includes the following paycoin-specific details:
        
        * sends Basic HTTP authentication headers
        * parses all JSON numbers that look like floats as Decimal
        
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        1. change the first line of setup.py to point to the directory of your installation of python 2.*
        2. run setup.py
        
        Note: This will only install paycoinrpc. If you also want to install jsonrpc to preserve
        backwards compatibility, you have to replace 'paycoinrpc' with 'jsonrpc' in setup.py and run it again.
        
        Or simply install the library using pip::
        
            pip install python-paycoinrpc
        
        
        
        Example
        =======
        .. code:: python
        
            from paycoinrpc.authproxy import AuthServiceProxy
            access = AuthServiceProxy("http://user:password@127.0.0.1:8332")
            access.getinfo()
            access.listreceivedbyaddress(6)
            access.sendtoaddress("P99rzy8MqEJLK62Ddz8xjjebg2xEmUsxDt", 10)
