        Applause SDK
        -------------
        
        In order to upload & distribute your build please run the following command in your terminal:
        
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ applause-tool sdk distribute COMPANY_ID APP_ID /path/to/build [-e john.smith@test.com -c "New Release"]
        
        
        * COMPANY_ID - ID of the company you created in the Applause SDK service.
        * APP_ID - ID of the application to which you wish to upload your builds to.
        * PATH - A full path to the build you wish to upload
        * (Optional) -e - emails to which you wish to distribute your build to. Please make sure to repeat this option for each email you wish to add.
        * (Optional) -c - changelog to attach to the build file in Applause SDK. This operation will add more information on the build OTA (over-the-air) installation page connected to the distribution email.
        
        
        **Example 1**
        
        Simple distribution with email list & changelog comming directly from the command line:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ applause-tool sdk distribute 3 133 test_files/Test.ipa -e release@applause.com -c "Fresh new release, straight from the oven"
        
        **Example 2**
        
        Applause Tool allows you to provide both email & changelog information directly from locally created files.
        In order to instruct Applause Tool to do so please add '@' sign at the start of the parameter value. For example:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ applause-tool sdk distribute 3 133 test_files/Test.ipa -e @/Users/john/files/AppDistributionList.txt -c "Fresh new release, straight from the oven"
        
        Where the content of AppDistributionList.txt is as follows:
        
        .. code-block::
        
            release@applause.com
            management@applause.com
            cannary@applause.com
        
        Please note that emails are separated out with new line characters.
        
        **Note**
        You can obtain both COMPANY_ID and APP_ID values from you product specific URL address. The URL scheme is:
        
        .. code-block::
        
            https://sdk.applause.com/companies/COMPANY_ID/application/APP_ID/dashboard/
        
        
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ applause-tool sdk distribute COMPANY_ID APP_ID /path/to/build [-e john.smith@test.com -c @/home/user/builds/1.0/release-notes.txt]
        
        
        Applause BETA
        --------------
        
        Currently only uploading build to Applause Mobile BETA Management is supported. Optionally changelog can be attached.
        
        **Example**
        
        Uploading build:
        
        .. code-block::
        
            applause-tool beta upload 11 22 ~/my_apps/ExampleApp.ipa [-c @/home/user/builds/1.0/release-notes.txt]
            
        
        Jenkins Integration
        =====================
        
        
        To integrate Applause Tool with Jenkins:
        
        * Make sure that you have Python2.6+ and applause-tool installed on your job worker nodes
        * We strongly recommend putting username and password for applause-tool logging in environment variables in worker node configuration
        * Add an ``Execute shell`` build step in which you can invoke applause-tool as an ordinary shell command, like below:
        
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            applause-tool login -u ${APPLAUSE_USER} -p ${APPLAUSE_PASSWORD}    
            applause-tool sdk distribute ...
        
        * You can also install the Jenkins plugin PostBuildScript (https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/PostBuildScript+Plugin) , which enables you
          to trigger those commands only if all the build steps are successfully completed.
