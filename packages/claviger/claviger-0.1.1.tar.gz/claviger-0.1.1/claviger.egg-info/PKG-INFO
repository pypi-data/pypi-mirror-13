        ********
        
        ``claviger`` manages the SSH ``authorized_keys`` files for you.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Tell ``claviger`` which keys you want to put on which server
        by creating a ``~/.claviger``-file.  An example::
        
            keys:
                laptop: ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAINYZEwjtu8w9Hsvx85TlYE95MLV9Whc3N1ajrH7+gu7A
                desktop: ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAICUef9frJIX7tjvZkYYMtr4IdD/GcKz6/X5qvLxM1Z8O desktop
                work: ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAICrycv44eyFwWJ7QQsGOnjEiAsFSdxIoAEzBPSO/AQB5 work
            servers:
                myprivateserver.com:
                    user: myusername
                    present:
                        - laptop
                        - desktop
                root@myotherserver.com:
                    like: myprivateserver.com
                    present:
                        - work
                    keepOtherKeys: false
                workuser@workserver.com:
                    present:
                        - work
                        - desktop
                    absent:
                        - laptop
        
        Then run ``claviger``.  By default ``claviger`` only tells which changes
        it wants to make, but does not make them.  If the changes seem fine,
        run ``claviger -f``, which allows ``claviger`` to make changes.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        To install ``claviger``, simply run::
        
           pip install claviger
