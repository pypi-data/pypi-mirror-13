Tutorial

Different tutorials are available as `IPython notebooks <http://ipython.org/notebook.html>`_.
Capsul may be used in two ways:

* a descriptive interface allows to develop processing bricks using simple Python functions and pipelines using a XML text description. :download:`See this notebook to demonstrate this approach <../_static/tutorial/capsul_descriptive_tutorial.ipynb>`.
* an object-oriented interface that uses Python classes programming. :download:`See this notebook to demonstrate this approach <../_static/tutorial/capsul_object_oriented_tutorial.ipynb>`. Note that this interface is compatible with the descriptive one, and allows more functionalities and tweak possibilities.

To run it, the following must be done:

* :ref:`install_guid`.
* have IPython installed.
* run the tutorial ipython notebook server, with Qt GUI support:

    ::

        ipython notebook --gui=qt my_tutorial.ipynb
