Python NetLink
==============

Python NetLink is a pythonic pure-Python API for the Linux NetLink set
of APIs (and some related ones where it makes sense). It aims to be as
efficient as possible, while still giving you high-level and easy-to-use
access to most common operations.

When high-level access is not enough, Python NetLink also gives you the
powerful low-level API that can be used to assemble arbitrary NetLink
and ETHTool commands, send them to the kernel and parse the response.
