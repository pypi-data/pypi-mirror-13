Face Recognition in Challenging Environments: An Experimental and Reproducible Research Survey
==============================================================================================

Welcome to the documentation of the experiments performed in the chapter "Face Recognition in Challenging Environments: An Experimental and Reproducible Research Survey" appearing in the Springer book "Face Recognition Across the Imaging Spectrum, ISBN 978-3-319-28499-6".
If you haven't read `the book chapter`_ yet, please download it from the `Idiap publication server <http://publications.idiap.ch/index.php/publications/show/3313>`_. You can also download it from the `Springer web page <http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-28501-6_11>`_, though the figure numbers reported in the :ref:`Experiments <experiments>` section are according to the former.
