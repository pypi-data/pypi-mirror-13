The face recognition algorithms
===============================
In this evaluation, we execute several well-known and state-of-the-art face recognition algorithms of different kinds.
Here, we only give a short overview of the algorithms used.
For a more detailed description including the original papers and a reason for the selection of the algorithms, please read section 3.1 of `the book chapter`_.

- Cohort LDA [#]_ [``LDA-IR``]: Performs PCA and LDA on two color channels of the images and compares model and probe features in Fisher space using a correlation function. [Lui12]_
- Grid graphs of Gabor jets [``Graphs``]: Extracts Gabor jets including Gabor phases from grid locations and compares model and probe graphs with a Gabor-phase based similarity function. [Zhang09]_
- Local Gabor binary pattern histogram sequence [``LGBPHS``]: Extracts local binary patterns (LBP) from Gabor wavelet filtered images, splits them into image blocks, extracts and concatenates histograms of LBP's and compares model and probe histograms with a histogram similarity measure. [Guenther12]_
- Inter-session variability modeling [``ISV``]: Extracts DCT features from image blocks, models them with a Gaussian mixture model, enrolls client models using ISV and computed probabilities, how probable probe features have been created by the client. [Wallace11]_
- Commercial of-the-shelf algorithm [``COTS``]: Uses a commercial algorithm (the vendor has requested to be anonymous) for feature extraction, client model enrollment and scoring.

.. [#] The name of the algorithm was changed from ``LDA-IR`` to ``CohortLDA`` by the authors of the CSU toolkit.
       Since we do not use the cohort in our experiments, we stick to the old name ``LDA-IR`` to avoid confusion.
