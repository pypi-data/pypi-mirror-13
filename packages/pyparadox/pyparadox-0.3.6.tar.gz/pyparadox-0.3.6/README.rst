Requirements
------------

* Operating system:

  * Linux: Any modern distribution with up-to-date packages
  * OS X: Latest version
  * Windows: 7 and later

* Python: 3.3+
* Qt: Qt 5.3+ via PyQt5

Features
--------

* Games: PyParadox supports all cross-platform grand strategy titles of
  Paradox Interactive that use the Clausewitz engine.  To date, these include:

  * Crusader Kings II
  * Europa Universalis IV

* Steam: PyParadox can be launched from Steam when starting the title from the
  Steam interface.  All Steam integration should work just fine.  A small
  configuration inside Steam is required to make sure that PyParadox is used
  instead of the stock launcher.  See the documentatation on how to set this
  up.
* PyParadox separates the expansion DLCs from the regular DLCs.  This should
  make it easier to start up your game with the exact expansions you want.
* PyParadox fixes an anomaly under Linux that causes the game to mess with
  the screen resolution when alt+tabbing.  This anomaly was introduced when
  Paradox released their (new) stock launcher for Linux.  By bypassing this
  launcher, PyParadox also bypasses the anomaly.
