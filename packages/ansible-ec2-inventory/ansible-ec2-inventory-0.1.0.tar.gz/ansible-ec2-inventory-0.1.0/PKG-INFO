Description: Ansible EC2 inventory
        =====================
        
        This Python module is based on the `original Ansible EC2 inventory
        script <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ansible/ansible/devel/contrib/inventory/ec2.py>`__
        that is linked in the `Ansible
        docs <http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_dynamic_inventory.html#example-aws-ec2-external-inventory-script>`__.
        
        The Python module in this repo fixes a few issues by being
        
        -  installable via ``pip`` / PyPi: no need to place code from the
           Ansible repo in your inventory.
        -  extendable for your needs: the class ``Ec2Inventory`` can be used as
           a base class for customizations.
