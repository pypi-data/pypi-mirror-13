Description: **gamerec** is Python package intended to help process game recordings for 2 payers' games.  
        File with game records can be loaded to Python collection object, be manipulated by user Python code,
        and then be saved back to file. Current very limited version of package only supports Chess game 
        and only .pgn file meta-data. 
        
        Below is an example of package use to save games from .pgn file to SQLite database:
        ```python
        from gamerec.storage.pgnfile.chess import ChessGameCollection as PGNChessGC
        from gamerec.storage.sqlite.chess import ChessGameCollection as SQLiteChessGC
        
        PGNFile = sys.argv[1]
        SQLFile = sys.argv[2]
        
        pgngc = PGNChessGC()
        pgngc.load(PGNFile)
        sqlgc = SQLiteChessGC()
        sqlgc.data = pgngc.data
        sqlgc.coding = "utf_8"
        sqlgc.save(SQLFile)
        ```
        
        Consider installing [normalizePGN](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/normalizePGN) which is an example of
        how this package may be used.
