Changes
=======

------------------

- Update tests.


1.3 (2015-09-30)
----------------

- Fix updateOrder that would create a new PersistentList object in the
  database each time the order is updated.


1.2 (2015-04-01)
----------------

- Introduce ObjectEditedEvent which is meant to used when the
  attribute of an object are edited. This makes possible to easily

  updateOrder() would have been called with a list containing multiple
  occurrences of a existing key in the mapping.

  component base classes out of Grok.
