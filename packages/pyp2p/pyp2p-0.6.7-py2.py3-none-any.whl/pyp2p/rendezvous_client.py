"""
This module handles all the operations required to bootstrap
the peer-to-peer network. It includes a custom client for
talking to the Rendezvous Server allowing the program to
accept and request connections with simultaneous and passive
nodes.

* A passive node is a node which can receive inbound connections.
* A simultaneous node is a node that cannot receive inbound
connections but its NAT uses predictable mapping so it can
receive connections through TCP hole punching.
    * A simultaneous node seeking to initiate hole punching I
    refer to as an "active simultaneous node."
    * A simultaneous node which has already bootstrapped
    becomes a "passive simultaneous node" whose purpose it
    is to accept challenges from active simultaneous nodes
    until its inbound slots are full.
* All other nodes are active nodes. Leechers who can only make
connections and take up valuable slots in the network.

The only special thing about this module is the TCP hole
punching algorithm, also known as TCP simultaneous open - it
works by timing two connections to occur simultaneously so that
their SYN 3-way handshakes cross over in such a way that their
TCP state machines consider the connection open. To do this,
you predict the NAT's remote mapping for the port and arrange
for both nodes to connect to each other's predicted port
simultaneously.

Todo: 
* Add better exception handling and tests.

        TCP hole punching algorithm. It uses network time servers to

        One thing to note is how sensitive TCP hole punching is to

        This function can predict 4 types of NATS.
        (Not adequately tested yet.)
        1. Preserving.
        Source port == remote port
        2. Delta.
        Remote port == source port + delta.
        3. Delta+1
        Same as delta but delta is only preserved when
        the source port increments by 1 (my understanding I
        may have misunderstood.)
        - This case is handled by manually using incremental,
        sequential ports for punching operations.
        4. Reuse.
        Same source port + addr == previous mapped remote port
        for that connection.
