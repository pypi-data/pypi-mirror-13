Description: =====
        nussl
        =====
        
        **nussl** (pronounced like "nuzzle") is a flexible python source separation library
        created by the ![Interactive Audio Lab] (http://music.cs.northwestern.edu/) at Northwestern University.
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        At its core, nussl contains implementations of the following source separation algorithms:
        * DUET
        * REPET
        * NMF
        * KAM
        * RPCA
        
        It provides an easy framework for adding new algorithms to experiment with and has some basic functionality for
        interacting with audio files in both the time and frequency domains. At the moment, nussl only works with .wav files.
        Please see the issues page before contacting the authors.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        We recommend getting installing anaconda prior to using this package.
        
        Installation is easy if you have pip:
        ``` $ pip install nussl (this doesn't work yet so don't do it)
        ...```
        
        You can also download and copy the nussl folder into your working directory.
        
        nussl requires:
            numpy, version >= 1.8.0
            scipy, version >= 0.13.0
            matplotlib, version >= 1.3.1
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        Full documentation is ![available here.](https://interactiveaudiolab.github.io/nussl/)
        
        Note: This package has been tested with python 2.7, but not 3.*. Use 3.* at your own peril!
        
        Status
        ------
        KAM, RPCA (and corresponding demos) need to be migrated to the framework.
