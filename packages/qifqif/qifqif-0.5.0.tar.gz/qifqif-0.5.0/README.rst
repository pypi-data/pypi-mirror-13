QIF is a format widely used by personal money management software such as
`GnuCash`_ to import information. Yet, the import process is particularly
tedious as it require to manually pair the transactions contained in the file
with categories (or "accounts" for double-entry bookkeeping systems).

qifqif augment your qif files by adding a category line for each transaction,
that additional information can then be used by accounting software to perform
automatic QIF imports.
It picks categories by searching for predefined keywords in transactions
descriptions lines and by repeating choices you previously made regarding
similar transactions.

  completion
- **Auditing mode:** review your transactions one by one
- **Batch mode (no interactive):** for easy integration with scripts
- **Easy-going workflow:** dreading the behemoth task of importing years of 
  accounting from a single file? Don't be. Go at your own pace and press

  you left it.
