bytecode
********

``bytecode`` is a Python module to modify bytecode.

The API is unstable. The project is closer to a proof-of-concept (PoC).

A code object is made of blocks and a block is a list of instructions. An
instruction has 3 main attributes: lineno, name, arg. Jumps use labels to
blocks, each block object has an unique label.

It's possible to get a flat code with only one block and without labels:
use Code.disassemble(code, use_labels=False).

bytecode 0.0 has been written to reimplement the CPython 3.6 peephole optimizer
in pure Python. This version only supports Python 3.6.
