        RWT (Run With This) provides on-demand dependency resolution.
        
        - Allows declaration of dependencies at runtime.
        - Downloads missing dependencies and makes their packages available for import.
        - Installs packages to a special staging location such that they're not installed after the process exits.
        - Keeps a cache of such packages for reuse.
        - Supersedes installed packages when required.
        - Re-uses the pip tool chain for package installation and pkg_reaources for working set management.
