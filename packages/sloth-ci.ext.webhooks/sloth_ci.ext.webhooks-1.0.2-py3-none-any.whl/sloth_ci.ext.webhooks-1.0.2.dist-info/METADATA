Send POST requests on build events in Sloth CI apps.

Executing actions of an app is called *build*. A build is considered *completed* if all its actions were completed. If some actions were completed and some failed, it's a *partially completed*; if all actions fail, the build *failed*.

This extension sends POST requests when your builds complete (fully or partially) or fail; just pick the desired notification level and the target URL.
