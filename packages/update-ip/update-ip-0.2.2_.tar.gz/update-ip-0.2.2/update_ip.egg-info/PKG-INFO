Description: update-ip
        =========
        
        An extensible Python utility to automatically update your IP address with
        dynamic DNS services, or notify you of such a change.  
        Currently, we support the following services:
        
         - WebFaction
         - NearlyFreeSpeech
         
        This utility was designed to be run
        periodically through a scheduling utility like cron to keep your IP address
        current.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        
            $ pip install update-ip
        
        Initial Setup
        -------------
        
        A configuration file is needed to store various options. This file can be 
        created through a wizard, by running:
        
            $ update-ip -w
        
        It will show you a list of available services, and ask 
        
         - where the configuration file should be kept
         - where the cache file should be kept (stores last known ip)
         - which domains do you want to update
         - the name of the service to run on IP change
         - service-dependent options
         
        The domains should be separated by commas, with no spaces.
        
        
        Normal Usage
        ------------
        
            $ update-ip /path/to/configuration/file
        
        Automatic Domains
        -----------------
        
        If no domains are configured on the configuration file, the updater will 
        only change the IPs of the domains that match the last known IP. This feature 
        may not be available on all services.
