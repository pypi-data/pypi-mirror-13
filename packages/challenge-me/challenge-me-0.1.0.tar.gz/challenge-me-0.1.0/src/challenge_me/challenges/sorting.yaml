  A circus is designing a tower routine consisting of people standing atop one anotherâ€™s shoulders.
  For practical and aesthetic reasons, each person must be both shorter and lighter than the person below him or her.
  Given the heights and weights of each person in the circus, write a method to compute the largest possible number of
  people in such a tower.

  Input: height weight, ...
  Output: top to bottom
tests:
  - {input: 65 100, 70 150, 56 90, 75 190, 60 95, 68 110, output: 56 90, 60 95, 65 100, 68 110, 70 150, 75 190}
