title: Set bit range
source: Cracking The Coding Interview by Gayle Laakman
description: |
  You are given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and j.
  Write a method to set all bits between i and j in N equal to M
  (e g , M becomes a substring of N located at i and starting at j).

  Input format: N M i j
tests:
  - {input: 10000000000 10101 2 6, output: 10001010100}
  - {input: 10000000 1111 3 7, output: 10111100}

title: Decimal to binary
source: Cracking The Coding Interview by Gayle Laakman
description: |
  Given a (decimal - e.g. 372) number that is passed in as a string, print the binary representation.
  If the number can not be represented accurately in binary, print “ERROR”
tests:
  - {input: 372, output: 101110100}
  - {input: 1, output: 1}
  - {input: 4096, output: 1000000000000}
  - {input: 4096g, output: ERROR}
  - {input: -1, output: ERROR}
  - {input: 2^4, output: ERROR}
  - {input: 2*2, output: ERROR}

description: |
  Given an integer, print the next smallest and next largest number that have the same number of 1 bits
  in their binary representation

title: Number of bits for conversion
source: Cracking The Coding Interview by Gayle Laakman
description: Write a function to determine the number of bits required to convert integer A to integer B.
tests:
  - {input: 31 14, output: 2}
  - {input: 21 37, output: 4}

title: Swap bits
source: Cracking The Coding Interview by Gayle Laakman
description: |
  Write a program to swap odd and even bits in an integer with as few instructions as possible
  (e g , bit 0 and bit 1 are swapped, bit 2 and bit 3 are swapped, etc). Return the new integer.
tests:
  - {input: 23, output: 43}
  - {input: 1, output: 2}
  - {input: 0, output: 0}
  - {input: 212, output: 232}
  - {input: 121505, output: 189778}

description: |
  How do you quickly count the number of set bits in a 32-bit integer
  in linear time? In constant time?
tests:
  - {input: 121505, output: 9}
  - {input: 7, output: 3}
  - {input: 8, output: 1}
  - {input: 2147483647, output: 32}

title: Sum of bits
source: https://github.com/kylesteiner/coding-challenges
description: |
  Write a function that takes in two binary strings and returns their sum,
  which is also a binary string.
tests:
  - {input: 10111001010101000 01110110101010000, output: 100101111111111000}
  - {input: 101110101000 011101101010111110, output: 11110011001100110}

title: Swap bits at position
source: Elements of Programming Interviews by Aziz, Lee, Prakash
description: |
  A 64-bit integer can be viewed as an array of 64 bits, with the bit at index 0
  corresponding to the least significant bit, and the bit at index 63 corresponding to
  the most significant bit. Implement code that takes as input a 64-bit
  integer x and swaps the bits at indices i and j.
