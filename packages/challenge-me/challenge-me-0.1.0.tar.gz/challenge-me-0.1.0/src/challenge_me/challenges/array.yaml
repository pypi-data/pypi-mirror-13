title: Erase matrix row and column
source: Cracking The Coding Interview by Gayle Laakman
description: |
  Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and column is set to 0.

  Elements in a row are separated with a space; rows are separated with a comma.
tests:
  - {input: 1 2 3 4, 5 6 7 8, 9 0 0 0, output: 1 2 0 0, 5 6 0 0, 0 0 0 0}
  - {input: 5, output: 5}
  - input: 123 68 21 67, 985 62 0 4, 637 2 3 96, 357 0 9 4, 368 75 2 7
