title: Find in rotated array
source: Cracking The Coding Interview by Gayle Laakman
description: |
  Given a sorted array of n integers that has been rotated an unknown number of times,
  give an O(log(n)) algorithm that finds an element in the array.
  You may assume that the array was originally sorted in increasing order.
tests:
  - {input: 5 15 16 19 20 25 1 3 4 5 7 10 14, output: 8}
  - {input: 1 15 16 19 20 25 1 3 4 5 7 10 14, output: 5}

description: |
  Given a sorted array of strings which is interspersed with empty strings,
  write a method to find the location of a given string.
tests:
  - {input: ball at    ball   car   dad  , output: 4}
  - {input: ballcar at    ball   car   dad  , output: -1}

title: Missing element
source: https://github.com/kylesteiner/coding-challenges
description: |
  You are given a read only array of n integers from 1 to n. Each integer appears exactly once except A which appears
  twice and B which is missing. Find A and B using less than O(n) space in O(n) time.

  You're given a read only array of n integers.
  Find out if any integer occurs more then n/3 times in the array in linear time and constant additional space.
