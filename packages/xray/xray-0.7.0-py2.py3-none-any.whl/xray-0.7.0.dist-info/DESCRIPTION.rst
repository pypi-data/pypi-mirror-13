.. note::

   xray has been renaemd to xarray! We issued this final release of xray
   v0.7.0, which is identical to xarray v0.7.0, to ease this transition. You
   can find xarray on PyPI at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xarray/.

**xarray** (formerly **xray**) is an open source project and Python package
that aims to bring the labeled data power of pandas_ to the physical sciences,
by providing N-dimensional variants of the core pandas data structures.

Our goal is to provide a pandas-like and pandas-compatible toolkit for
analytics on multi-dimensional arrays, rather than the tabular data for which
pandas excels. Our approach adopts the `Common Data Model`_ for self-
describing scientific data in widespread use in the Earth sciences:
``xarray.Dataset`` is an in-memory representation of a netCDF file.
