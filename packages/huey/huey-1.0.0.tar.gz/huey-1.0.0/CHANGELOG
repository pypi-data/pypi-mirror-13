v1.0.0
------

What follows is a description of the changes between 0.4.9 and 1.0.0. There are
some backwards-incompatible changes to be aware of as well as new options for
the consumer. Most APIs are the same, however.


Backwards incompatible changes:

* ``huey.djhuey`` moved to ``huey.contrib.djhuey``. You will need to update
  any import statements as well as your Django ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting to
  reflect the new module path.
* Redis backend is now the only one available, and the corresponding code moved
  from ``huey.backends.redis_backend`` to ``huey.storage``.
* Removed the "RabbitMQ" and "SQLite" queue backends.
* Removed the ``-t`` and ``--threads`` option from the consumer. You should now
  use ``-w`` or ``--workers``.
* Removed the ``-p`` and ``--periodic`` no-op options from the consumer. These
  are enabled by default so the option had no meaning.
* The ``scheduler-interval`` option is configured using ``-s`` when previously
  it was ``-S``. Furthermore, this must be a value between 1 and 60.
* Removed the ``peewee_helpers`` module.


New features:

* The queue consumer now supports multi-process or multi-greenlet execution
  models (in addition to multi-threaded, which previously was the only option).
* Added `pending()`, `scheduled()` and `all_results()` methods to the `Huey`
  class to allow introspection of the Queue's state at the current moment in
  time.
