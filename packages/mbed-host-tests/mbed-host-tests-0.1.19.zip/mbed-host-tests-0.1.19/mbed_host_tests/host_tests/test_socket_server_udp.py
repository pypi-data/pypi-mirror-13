        Note:
        On Windows 7 call to socket.getfqdn() gives . (Fully qualified domain name)
        In order for socket.gethostbyname() to work it expects that computer's full name is like ..

        The full computer name may not be in . format. In that case socket.gethostbyname()
        fails to resolve socket.getfqdn() (.) into the IP address.

        Possible solutions:
        By configuration: Follow the link for steps for configuring DNS suffix:
        https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc786695(v=ws.10).aspx

        In code: If gethostbyname() fail for FQDN then try host name.
        As hostname resolution to IP succeeds.
