        Features
        --------
        
        * Reads a fasta file and generates any number of mutated fasta replicate files.
        * Mutations can be any number of single-base substitutions, insertions, and deletions at randomly 
          chosen positions, uniformly distributed across the genome.
        * Generates a summary file listing the original base and the mutation for all mutated positions.

        History
        -------
        
        0.2.0 (2016-01-15)
        ---------------------
        
        * Allow lowercase bases in the input fasta file.
        * Do not mutate gaps or ambiguous positions.
        * Add a command line switch to show the program version.
        
        0.1.1 (2015-06-17)
        ---------------------
        
        * Remove spaces from the summary file column headings.  This will simplify downstream
          analysis in some scripting languages.
        
        
        0.1.0 (2015-05-21)
