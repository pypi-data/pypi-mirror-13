            "body": "While free software by any other name would give you the same freedom, it makes a big difference which name we use: different words convey different ideas.\r\n\r\nIn 1998, some of the people in the free software community began using the term \u201copen source software\u201d instead of \u201cfree software\u201d to describe what they do. The term \u201copen source\u201d quickly became associated with a different approach, a different philosophy, different values, and even a different criterion for which licenses are acceptable. The Free Software movement and the Open Source movement are today separate movements with different views and goals, although we can and do work together on some practical projects.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental difference between the two movements is in their values, their ways of looking at the world. For the Open Source movement, the issue of whether software should be open source is a practical question, not an ethical one. As one person put it, \u201cOpen source is a development methodology; free software is a social movement.\u201d For the Open Source movement, non-free software is a suboptimal solution. For the Free Software movement, non-free software is a social problem and free software is the solution.",
