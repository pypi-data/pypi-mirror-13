Description: podcastbackup
        =============
        
        Back up podcasts with metadata from a feed URL. Progress indicator and
        resuming. Hacky, only really tested against FeedBurner/libsyn feeds.
        
        When you run it, you get a directory named after the podcast with a list
        of ``mp3`` files and ``metadata.json`` files.
        
        ::
        
            tree /mnt/backups/podcast/
            /mnt/backups/podcast/
            ├── bestshowever1.mp3.metadata.json
            ├── bestshowever1.mp3
            ├── bestshowever2.mp3.metadata.json
            ├── bestshowever2.mp3
            ├── bestshowever3.mp3.metadata.json
            ├── bestshowever3.mp3
        
        The ``metadata.json`` files look like:
        
        .. code:: json
        
            {
                "text": "This is probably the best show yet!",
                "href": "http://bestshowever.cachefly.net/bestshowever/bestshowever42.mp3",
                "title": "Best Show Ever 42: All The Answers"
            }

        Usage
        -----
        
        ::
        
            $ pip install podcastbackup
        
        Works with Python 2 and 3.
        
        Ignores file
        ------------
        
        Drop a file named ``.ignores`` into the download directory of a
        particular podcast to skip downloading particular episodes.
        
        Useful for skipping over broken / missing episodes. An example of the
        syntax is in the .ignores file with this repo.
