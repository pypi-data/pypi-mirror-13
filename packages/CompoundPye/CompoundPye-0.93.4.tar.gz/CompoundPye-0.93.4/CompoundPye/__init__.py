#@section overview Overview
#
#This package provides tools to model the motion detector of insects' visual system. It is designed for easy set-up of columnar structured neural networks, as in arthropods' compound eyes.

#@section structure Structure
#
# To get an idea of how to use the module, a good starting point is to run GUI.py in the executables folder
#\n
# BEWARE: No usage example yet, and GUI tool-tips still missing, so setting up simulations without instructions will be hard.
