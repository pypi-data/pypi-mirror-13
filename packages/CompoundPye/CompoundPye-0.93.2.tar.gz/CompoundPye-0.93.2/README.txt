You downloaded the source of the CompoundPye package, congratulations! CompoundPye is framework designed for easy modelling and simulations of neural networks of arthropods' compound eyes.
It is written in Python (tested on Ubuntu 14.04 with Python 2.7.) and requires some other python packages:

* numpy (tested: 1.9.2),
* PyQt4,
* networkx (tested: 1.10),
* cv2 (Python's openCV interface; optional for video stimuli).

A good starting point is the CompoundPye's GUI, run it using python in the command line:
*python executables/GUI.py*
