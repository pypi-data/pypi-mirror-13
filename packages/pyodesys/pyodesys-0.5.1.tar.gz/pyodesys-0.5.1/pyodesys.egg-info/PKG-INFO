Description: 
        Package for solving (symbolic) systems of first order differential equations
        numerically.
        
        pyodesys ties computer algebra systems like SymPy and symengine, and numerical
        solvers such as ODEPACK in SciPy, CVode in sundials, GSL or odeint together.
