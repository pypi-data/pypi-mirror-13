py-jsonapi
==========

.. note::

    This library is currently in the beta phase.
    If you have any suggestions or found bugs, please create a new issue.


This library is a toolkit for building a http://jsonapi.org/ compliant API. It
has built in support for many web frameworks and database drivers:

*   flask
*   tornado
*   sqlalchemy
*   mongoengine

Furthermore, it can be extended to work with **all web frameworks and database
engines**.

But that's not all: We support **blocking and (soon) asynchronous** code.
