# This example uses status messages and message passing to run 'setup'
# coroutine at remote process to prepare it for processing jobs.

# This example is a variation of discomp3.py; it shows computations
# executed with AsyncThreadPool can send messages (in this case, to
# the client).

# DiscoroStatus must be imported in global scope as below; otherwise,
# unserializing status messages fails (if external scheduler is used)

# discoronode expects user computations to be generator functions (to
# create coroutines) that will 'yield' within pulse_interval (default
# 10 seconds). Otherwise, the daemon coroutine that sends pulse
# messages to scheduler will not get a chance to do so, causing
# scheduler to assume the node may be unreachable and abandon the
# computation. In this example, user computations are executed in
# threads, using AsyncThreadPool. The computation is simulated with
# 'time.sleep'. (Note that 'time.sleep' shouldn't be used in
# coroutines, as this will block entire asyncoro framework.)

# This generator function is sent to remote discoro process to run
# coroutines there. Note that compute_proc and proc_setup run in the
# same process (and share same address space), so global variables are
# shared (updates in one coroutine are visible in other coroutnies in
# the same process).
