Description: Pollinator is a Python package that uses select/poll with generators to ease the
        development of simple non-blocking network services, avoiding any need for threading.
        Along with the core code are implementations of a simple HTTP server and netstring-based
        RPC code for client and server.
        
        This code is under early development and will centralize utility code already present
        in the "taskforce" and "rainbarrel" packages.
