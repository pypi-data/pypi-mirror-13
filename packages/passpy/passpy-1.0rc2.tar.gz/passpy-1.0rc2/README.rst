passpy has been written to be a platform independent library and cli
that is compatible with `ZX2C4's pass`_.

.. _ZX2C4's pass: http://www.passwordstore.org

passpy saves your passwords in gpg encrypted files and optionally uses
git as a revision tool.  All files are stored inside
``~/.password-store`` (or any other location) and can be organised into
folders.  You can also just copy the whole store to have your
passwords available where ever you like.

For further information on the project head on over to `github`_ or
`readthedocs`_.
