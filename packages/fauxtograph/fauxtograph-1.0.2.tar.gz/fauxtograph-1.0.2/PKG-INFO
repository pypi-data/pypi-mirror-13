Description: Python module for training unsupervised deep, generative models on images. It uses Chainer for the Neural Network framework and implements several methods, including Variational Auto-encoders, Generative Adversarial Networks, and their combination. These methods are built with reference to personal notes and the following papers:
        1) Diederik P Kingma, Max Welling; "Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes"; (2013).
        2) Alec Radford et. al.; "Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks"; (2015).
        3) Anders Boesen et. al.; "Autoencoding Beyond Pixels Using a Learned Similarity Metric"; (2015).
