Marionette_ is a Mozilla project to enable remote automation in Gecko-based
projects, including desktop Firefox, mobile Firefox, and Firefox OS. It is
inspired by `Selenium Webdriver`_.

This package defines the transport layer used by a Marionette client to
communicate with the Marionette server embedded in Gecko.  It has no entry
points; rather it's designed to be used by a Marionette client implementation.
