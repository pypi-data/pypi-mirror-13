Description: Mission Control
        ===============
        
        A project launcher for Marathon
        
        Installation
        ------------
        To install using a terminal::
        
            $ virtualenv ve
            $ source ve/bin/activate
            (ve)$ pip install mission-control2
            (ve)$ export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE="mc2.settings"
            (ve)$ ve/bin/django-admin migrate --noinput
        
        Running
        -------
        
        Because this system uses GitHub with OAuth2 for authentication there are a few
        steps one needs to complete in order to get a working system:
        
        Create a super user::
        
            (ve)$ ve/bin/django-admin createsuperuser
        
        Start the application on local address ``127.0.0.1:8000``::
        
            (ve)$ ve/bin/django-admin runserver
        
        OAuth works with HTTP based callbacks & token exchange, for this to work our
        local server needs to be reachable on the Internet. Ngrok_ is a great utility
        that allows for this. Follow the installation instructions on the Ngrok_
        website for your operating system. Once installed run::
        
            $ ngrok 8000
        
        This will generate a random ``ngrok.com`` subdomain for you on which your
        local server will be reachable. The random subdomain address is useful for
        adhoc testing but we would recommend you use something predictable. This can
        be done using the ``-subdomain`` command line argument::
        
            $ ngrok -subdomain mytestingtunnel 8000
        
        Next you need to generate a pair of secret keys for OAuth in your GitHub
        account. You can do this at https://github.com/settings/applications/new:
        
        .. image:: http://note.io/1s0ZMdb
            :align: center
        
        Once saved, GitHub will have generated the unique keys you will need to
        complete the OAuth setup:
        
        .. image:: http://note.io/1Aq99U8
            :align: center
        
        You can specify the following ``environment variables`` to configure the app:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            # Django settings
            SECRET_KEY
            PROJECT_ROOT
            DATABASE_URL
        
            # Mesos Settings
            MESOS_DEFAULT_MEMORY_ALLOCATION
            MESOS_MARATHON_HOST
            MESOS_HTTP_PORT
            MESOS_DEFAULT_CPU_SHARE
            MESOS_DEFAULT_INSTANCES
        
            # Log Driver settings
            LOGDRIVER_PATH
            LOGDRIVER_BACKLOG
        
            # Sentry configuration
            RAVEN_DSN
            RAVEN_CONFIG
        
            # Social Auth
            SOCIAL_AUTH_GOOGLE_OAUTH2_KEY
            SOCIAL_AUTH_GOOGLE_OAUTH2_SECRET
        
        Once all this is done visit Mission Control via your
        custom http://mytestingtunnel.ngrok.com tunnel and sign-up via GitHub.
        
        You'll be greeted with an empty page since no applications have been created
        yet. Only Django ``superusers`` are allowed to create new applications.
        You'll need to login into the Django admin page as the superuser you created
        earlier and promote the account created via GitHub to being a super user
        to expose the application creation features.
