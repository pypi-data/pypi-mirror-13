# Quickstart

Assuming you have a [Wagtail](https://wagtail.io/) project up and running:

``` $ pip install wagtailcommonblocks```

Add commonblocks to your `settings.py` in the INSTALLED_APPS section, before the core wagtail packages:

```
...
    'commonblocks',
    'wagtail.contrib.wagtailsitemaps',
...
```
# Available blocks

You can override the headings of the `CommonHeadingBlock` block:

    ('h2', 'h2'),
)
```
