``sortedmap 0.1``
=================

A sorted mapping object.

``sortedmap`` is a python ``dict`` api interface to the C++ ``std::map`` type.
``sortedmap`` implements the full ``dict`` object interface with a few
differences:

1. Objects are stored in a red black tree. All keys must be comparable to
   eachother though they do not need to be hashable. This means all keys must
   implement at least ``__lt__`` and ``__eq__``.
2. ``O(log(n))`` lookup, insert, and deletes because of the red- black tree
   backing. This is worse than ``dict`` which offers ``O(1)`` lookup, insert,
   and delete. The ``C++`` implementation offers low constants
3. ``popitem`` accepts a ``first=True`` argument which says to pop from the
   front or the back. ``dict.popitem`` pops an abitrary item; however
   ``sortedmap`` pops the first or the last item.



Dependencies
------------

``sortedmap`` has no python package depencencies but requires
``CPython 2.7 or >=3.4``. ``sortedmap`` depends on CPython 2 or 3 and some means
of compiling ``C++14``.  We recommend using ``g++`` to compile ``sortedmap``.
Compilation and testing was done with ``gcc 5.3.0``
