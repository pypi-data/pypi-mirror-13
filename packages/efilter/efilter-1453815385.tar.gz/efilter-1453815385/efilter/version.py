EFILTER versioning scheme.

EFILTER version is the UTC UNIX epoch of the git commit that the package is
being built from. This allows us to disambiguate different builds of the same
major version, and simply map each build back to the commit it came from.

It would be more convenient to just use the git commitish as version strings,
but PEP 0440 mandates that version numbers increment over time, which the
commitish, being output of a hash function, doesn't.
