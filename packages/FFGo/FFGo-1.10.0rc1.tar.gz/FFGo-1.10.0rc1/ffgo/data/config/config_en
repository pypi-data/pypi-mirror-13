## List of 'fgfs' command line options. Enable the options you want to use by
## removing the hash symbol at the beginning of the appropriate lines.

## RENDERING OPTIONS
## Enable fullscreen mode.
# --enable-fullscreen

## Specify the geometry of FlightGear's window (no need to specify it if you
## use --enable-fullscreen).
# --geometry=800x600

## OTHER
## Enter your callsign. Note that it's currently limited to seven characters.
## Please don't choose a callsign already in use by someone else on the
## multiplayer network.
# --callsign=

## Enable automatic scenery download as you fly:
#--enable-terrasync
## ... or disable it in case it causes problems, or you just can't use it
## (for instance, if you are not connected to the Internet).
#--disable-terrasync

## If you want to choose the directory used for automatic scenery download
## (the default being $FG_HOME/TerraSync).
##
## Note: setting this to a directory that is not under FG_HOME may cause
##       failure to read some scenery files in recent FlightGear versions, due
##       to stricter permissions rules (this new FlightGear permission scheme
##       is still in flux, therefore this won't necessarily be the case
##       anymore when you read it).
#--terrasync-dir=/path/to/the/folder/of/your/choice

## You can choose the start time of day for your flight.
#--timeofday=noon

## Summer and winter use different textures.
#--season=summer

## You may find the 2D Head-Up Display more readable than the 3D one.

# --prop:/sim/frame-rate-throttle-hz=35
