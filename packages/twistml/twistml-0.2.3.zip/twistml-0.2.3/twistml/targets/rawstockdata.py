            Full path to the .csv file containing the stock data.
        pricecolumn : int
            The column index of the closing price column within the

        Parameters
        ----------
        prices : dict[datetime, float]
            A dictionary that has datetime stamps as keys and the stock
            prices as values. (Can be generated from a .csv file using
            the StockCsvReader class.)
        fromdate : str
            Start of the daterange for which to get the stock prize
            changes as a string in `dateformat`.
        todate : str
            End of the daterange for which to get the stock prize
            changes as a string in `dateformat`.
        dateformat : str, optional
            The dateformat as used by datetime.strftime and
            datetime.strptime. (See python documentation for details.)
        return_classes : bool, optional
            If True, the returned changes will be 1 for days with
            positive price change and -1 for days with negative price
            change, instead of continous values. (If
            `ignore_neutral_days` is False 0 will be returned for days
            without price change.) (default is False)
        ignore_neutral_days : bool, optional
            Days that have no change in stock price are treated as
            nonexistant. This almost exclusively removes weekends and
            bank holidays, but may on occasion remove a legitimate
            datapoint. (default is True)
        logger : logging.Logger, optional
            A logger object, used to display / log console output
            (default is None, which implies quiet execution).

        Returns
        -------
        daily_changes : dict[datetime, float]
            A dictionary mapping the percentage change in stockprice
            to a datetime. This does not include dates for which no
            change can be computed (either because the date itself or
            the day before are not part of the `prices` dict).
