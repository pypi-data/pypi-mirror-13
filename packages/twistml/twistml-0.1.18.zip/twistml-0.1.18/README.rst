TwistML
=======

Disclaimer
----------
This package is still very much under developement. 

I am already seing a surprising (at least to me) number of downloads. Thank 
You for your interest, but please do not be disappointed, if you do not find
what you are looking for, yet.

Installation
------------
You can use pip to install TwistML like so::
	pip install twistml

Please make you sure you **have numpy installed** as well. I have opted out of 
adding numpy to the install_requires for reasons described `here
<https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/2434>`_, so it will not be installed
automatically by pip.
