Description: TwistML
        =======
        
        Disclaimer
        ----------
        This package is still very much under developement. 
        
        I am already seing a surprising (at least to me) number of downloads. Thank 
        You for your interest, but please do not be disappointed, if you do not find
        what you are looking for, yet.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        You can use pip to install TwistML like so::
        
        	$ pip install twistml
        
        Please make you sure you **have numpy and scipy installed** as well. I have opted out of 
        adding them to the install_requires for reasons described `here
        <https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/2434>`_, so it will not be installed
        automatically by pip.
