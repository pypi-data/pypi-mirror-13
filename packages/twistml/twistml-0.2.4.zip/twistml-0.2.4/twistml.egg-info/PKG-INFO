Description: TwistML
        =======
        
        Disclaimer
        ----------
        This package is still very much under developement. 
        
        At this point most of the intended functionality is in place, but
        documentation is still very spotty.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        You can use pip to install TwistML like so::
        
        	$ pip install twistml
        
        Please make you sure you **have numpy, scipy and gensim installed** as
        well. I have opted out of adding them to the install_requires as this
        has caused problems in my own tests on windows machines. (For numpy the
        problem is described `here
        <https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/2434>`_.) So these packages will
        not be installed automatically by pip.
        
        
        Known Issues & Planned Improvements
        ===================================
        
        - Implement a DateRange class and replace all occurences of fromdate,
          todate, dateformat.
          
        - Implement find_files() without dateranges at all. It should be
          possible to simply process all files within a directory (also
          recursively)
          
        - TwistML currently assumes raw twitter data to be avaialble as one
          json file per day. Make sure the internet-archive's file scheme is
          supported as well
          
        - Add support for hourly time resolution instead of daily only.
        
        - Evaluation subpackage can only deal with binary classification.
          Possibly explore adding multiclass.
          
        - The way logging is currently set up is weird and should be reworked.
        
        - gensim's LabeledSentence is deprecated, use TaggedDocument instead

        - classification targets are now 0 / 1 instead of -1 / 1
        
        - added toydata module -> create some toydata for testing
        
        - added F1-Score to classifcation evaluation
        
        - added additional window functions: window_stack and window_element_avg
