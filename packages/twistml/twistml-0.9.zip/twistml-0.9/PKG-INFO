Description: TwistML
        =======
        
        TwistML is a package that makes it easier to work with raw twitter data
        for machine learning tasks, like predicting changes in the stock 
        market.
        
        TwistML implements a pipeline that includes filtering of the twitter 
        data, preprocessing, feature extraction into several feature 
        representations (bag of words, sentiments, Doc2Vec), regression / 
        classification using algorithms from the sklearn package, and
        model selection / evaluation.
        
        The API documentation is available at `TwistML's PyPI page 
        <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/twistml>`_. A more usage focuse
        documentation is coming soon, until then you can get the full package
        from BitBucket (also linked at the PyPI page) and check out the 
        experiments folder for some usage examples.
        
        TwistML was developed as part of my master's thesis and I hope to keep
        improving it afterwards.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        You can use pip to install TwistML like so::
        
        	$ pip install twistml
        
        Please make you sure you **have numpy, scipy and gensim installed** as
        well. I have opted out of adding them to the install_requires as this
        has caused problems in my own tests on windows machines. (For numpy the
        problem is described `here
        <https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/2434>`_.) So these packages will
        not be installed automatically by pip.
        
        
        Known Issues & Planned Improvements
        ===================================
        
        - Implement a DateRange class and replace all occurences of fromdate,
          todate, dateformat.
          
        - Implement find_files() without dateranges at all. It should be
          possible to simply process all files within a directory (also
          recursively)
          
        - TwistML currently assumes raw twitter data to be avaialble as one
          json file per day. Make sure the internet-archive's file scheme is
          supported as well
          
        - Add support for hourly time resolution instead of daily only.
        
        - Evaluation subpackage can only deal with binary classification.
          Possibly explore adding multiclass.
          
        - The way logging is currently set up is weird and should be reworked.
        
        - gensim's LabeledSentence is deprecated, use TaggedDocument instead
        
        
        Changes
        =======
        
        Version 0.9
        -----------
        
        - Changed status to Beta
        
        - Added API documentation generated via sphinx and numpydoc
        
        - Doc2VecTransformer now supports iterative training (as explained 
        `here <http://rare-technologies.com/doc2vec-tutorial/>`_)
        
        - Regression evaluation can now treat predictions as binary 
        classifications and evaluate AUC and F1
        
        - Changed some command line scripts to have more intuitive usage
        
        - various small fixes
        
        
        Version 0.2.4
        -------------
        
        **ATTENTION: Some of these may break existing code!**!
        
        - renamed combine_tweets.py to combine.py
        
        - added support for stacking of features
        
        - classification targets are now 0 / 1 instead of -1 / 1
        
        - added toydata module -> create some toydata for testing
        
        - added F1-Score to classifcation evaluation
        
        - added additional window functions: window_stack and window_element_avg
        
        Version 0.2.3
        -------------
        
        - Improved long_description generation

        - Also improved documentation for tml-generate-features (on cmd line as
          well as docstring)
        
        - improved test coverage 
        
        Version 0.2.0
        -------------
