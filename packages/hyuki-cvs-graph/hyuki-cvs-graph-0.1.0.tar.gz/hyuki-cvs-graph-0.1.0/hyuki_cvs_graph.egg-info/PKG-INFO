        This tool makes table which is written project-name, day number from today and commit-status.
        
        Furtheremore, if cross point which project-name and day number is written D by red color,
        this means that the project does not committed.
        
        If it is written M by yellow color, this means that the project is committed some times less than 10.
        
        If it is written L by green color, this means that the project is committed some times more than or equal to 10.
