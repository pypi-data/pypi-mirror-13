Changelog
==========

1.3.2 (2016/02/23)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Check for missing davfs2 group membership and warn user if so.
* Use *fusermount -u* instead of *umount* for sshfs unmount. On some
  distros, unmount of a sshfs filesystem, by a normal user, will fail.
* Big improvement to automatic mount and unmount at login/logout.
  This is no longer KDE centric and should work on any DE/WM that uses
  ``~/.config/autostart/*.desktop`` to start applications at login.
  So far it's tested on the following distros: Slackware, openSUSE and 
  Debian. And the following DE's: KDE4, KDE5, Gnome shell, MATE, XFCE,
  LXDE and LXQt.
* Fix bug in adding SFTP connection without password-less key. Now it
  no longer specifies the ssh key in the mount options.

1.2 (2016/01/28)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Changed README.md (Markdown) to README.rst (ReStructured Text).
* Changed python packaging (setup.py) from distutils to setuptools.
* Preparation for uploading to PyPi (pip).
* Fix: The connections list (table) columns, when adding first 
  connection, are now spaced properly.

1.1 (2015.03.29)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Initial public release.
