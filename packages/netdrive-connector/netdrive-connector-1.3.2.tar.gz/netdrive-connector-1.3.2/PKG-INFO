Description: netdrive-connector
        ==================
        
        **Utility to setup mountable SFTP and WebDAV connections on Linux/UNIX systems.**
        
        
        Introduction
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        netdrive-connector is a simple PyQt4 wrapper for the existing and standardized
        way to get SFTP and WebDAV shared folders (remote filesystems) mounted into your
        local filesystem. Usually a folder inside your home folder. With the optional 
        addition of auto-mounting at desktop login and passwordless login.
        
        It makes it quick and easy to get one of these shared folders up and running 
        without having to know how to set them up manually.
        
        
        News
        ~~~~
        
        **Version 1.3.2 released.**
        
        The changes are as follows:
        
        - Check for missing davfs2 group membership and warn user if so.
        - Use *fusermount -u* instead of *umount* for sshfs unmount. On some
          distros, unmount of a sshfs filesystem, by a normal user, will fail.
        - Big improvement to automatic mount and unmount at login/logout. 
          This is no longer KDE centric and should work on any DE/WM that uses 
          ``~/.config/autostart/*.desktop`` to start applications at login. 
          So far it's tested on the following distros: Slackware, openSUSE,
          Debian and Ubuntu. And the following DE's: KDE4, KDE5, Gnome shell, MATE, XFCE,
          LXDE, LXQt and Unity.
        - Fix bug in adding SFTP connection without password-less key. Now it
          no longer specifies the ssh key in the mount options.
        
        
        Pros
        ~~~~
        
        - Simple and effective.
        - Uses robust existing technologies (sshfs, davfs2).
        - No unnecessary config files or metadata.
        - Saves learning how to set up these remote filesystems manually.
        
        
        Cons
        ~~~~
        
        - May inhibit learning of underlying techologies.
        
        
        Current Limitations
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - No UI localization support (English only).
        - Only available for Linux. Hopefully FreeBSD to follow soon (sshfs only).
        - Makes some assumptions about the system configuration.
        
        
        Installation Notes
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Check in your distributions' repository first. If it's too out of date,
          use one of the following methods instead.
        - Package repos for various distros can be found on OpenSUSE Build Service
          here: `<https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3Aethoms&package=netdrive-connector>`_.
        - Slackware has a SlackBuild available on SlackBuilds.org.
        - Prebuilt packages are avaibale in the 'packages' directory. Make sure
          dependencies are installed (see below).
        - If no packages are available for your distribution, install distro specific
          dependencies then install from PyPi (pip).
        
        **From PyPi (pip)**
        
        Make sure dependencies are installed (see below).
        
        .. code-block::
        
            pip2 install netdrive-connector
        
        **From source**
        
        Make sure dependencies are installed (see below).
        
        .. code-block::
        
            git clone https://github.com/ethoms/netdrive-connector.git
            cd netdrive-connector
            python setup.py sdist
            pip install dist/netdrive-connector-*.tar.gz
        
        
        **From basic rpm package**
        
        Make sure dependencies are installed (see below).
        
        *Caveats: this will create a very basic rpm package without dependency information.*
        
        .. code-block::
        
            git clone https://github.com/ethoms/netdrive-connector.git
            cd netdrive-connector
            python setup.py bdist_rpm
            rpm -ivh netdrive-connector-*.noarch.rpm
        
        This may be converted to other packaging systems using 'alien'.

        Usage Notes
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Any regular user that adds a connection will need to know the root user password. This is the
        way that netdrive-connector elevates permissions. For a user that is an administrator 
        by use of sudo, they can set the root user password with the following command:
        ``sudo passwd root``.
        
        Any regular user accounts that intend to mount a connection may need additional
        unix groups ( fuse, sshfs, davfs2). This varies depending on the distribution.
        
        In addition to the main GUI tool, there are command line utilities to add and remove
        connections. These are as follows:
        
        **add-sftp-connector**
        
        .. code-block::
        
            # add-sftp-connector
            
            Usage (1): /usr/bin/add-sftp-connector username@server_url mount_point
            Example  : /usr/bin/add-sftp-connector bill@host1.example.com:/shares /home/bill/Shares
            Example  : /usr/bin/add-sftp-connector bill@host1.example.com:22/shares /home/bill/Shares
            
            Usage (2): /usr/bin/add-sftp-connector username@server_url mount_point key
            Example  : /usr/bin/add-sftp-connector bill@host1.example.com:/shares /home/bill/Shares key
            Example  : /usr/bin/add-sftp-connector bill@host1.example.com:22/shares /home/bill/Shares key
            
            Usage (3): /usr/bin/add-sftp-connector username@server_url mount_point key sftp_password
            Example  : /usr/bin/add-sftp-connector bill@host1.example.com:/shares /home/bill/Shares key opensesame
            Example  : /usr/bin/add-sftp-connector bill@host1.example.com:22/shares /home/bill/Shares key opensesame
            !WARNING!: this method may save your password to the HISTFILE (command history)
            
            NOTE:    : options (2) and (3) will add a local ssh key to the remote authorized_keys for password-less login.
        
        **remove-sftp-connector**
        
        .. code-block::
        
            # remove-sftp-connector
            
            Usage (1): /usr/bin/remove-sftp-connector username@server_url mount_point
            Example  : /usr/bin/remove-sftp-connector bill@host1.example.com:22/shares /home/bill/Shares
        
        
        **add-webdav-connector**
        
        .. code-block::
        
            # add-webdav-connector
            
            Usage (1): /usr/bin/add-webdav-connector server_url mount_point
            Example  : /usr/bin/add-webdav-connector http://webdav.example.com:80/shares /home/bill/Shares
            
            Usage (2): /usr/bin/add-webdav-connector server_url mount_point username
            Example  : /usr/bin/add-webdav-connector http://webdav.example.com:80/shares /home/bill/Shares bill
            
            Usage (3): /usr/bin/add-webdav-connector server_url mount_point username password
            Example  : /usr/bin/add-webdav-connector http://webdav.example.com:80/shares /home/bill/Shares bill opensesame
            !WARNING!: this method may save your password to the HISTFILE (command history)
            
            NOTE:    : options (2) and (3) will add an entry to the ~/.davfs2/secrets file for password-less login.
        
        **remove-webdav-connector**
        
        .. code-block::
        
            # remove-webdav-connector
            
            Usage (1): /usr/bin/remove-webdav-connector server_url mount_point
            Example  : /usr/bin/remove-webdav-connector http://webdav.example.com:80/shares /home/bill/Shares
        
        
        Packaging Notes
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - I'm always willing to assist in packaging for as many distros as possible. Create
          an 'Issue' if you need assistance from me.
        - Subject to the distribution and it's fuse, davfs2, sshfs packages, a user may need 
          adding to additional groups (fuse, davfs/davfs2 etc.). In Slackware, only the davfs2 
          group is required.
        - An ssh-askpass program should be installed and configured to work with sshfs.
        - At some point in the operation of adding/removing connections, a temporary 
          script is placed in /tmp and given execute permission. After use it is deleted. 
          A regular user will need permissions to do this.
        - The setuid bit on /usr/bin/mount.davfs* must be set in order for a user to mount davfs2 filesystems.
        
        
        Dependencies
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - **python** v2.7 or above (not python 3).
        - **PyQt4** v4.8 or above (python-qt4 on debian based distros).
        - **ssh-askpass**, or a variant of. Tested with *x11-ssh-askpass*.
        - **expect** (version 5.x or above should be OK).
        - **fuse**.
        - **sshfs** (*sshfs-fuse*) v2.4 or above recommended.
        - **davfs2** v1.4.6 or above recommended.
        - **openssh-client**.
        - awk, grep, ls, cut, chown, cat, chmod, sed, uname, who, groups.
        
        *Note: Either davfs2 or sshfs are not required if that connection type is unused.*
