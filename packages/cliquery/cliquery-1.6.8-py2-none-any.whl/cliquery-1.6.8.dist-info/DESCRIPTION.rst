# cliquery [![PyPI Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/cliquery.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cliquery) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/huntrar/cliquery.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/huntrar/cliquery) [![PyPI Monthly downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/cliquery.svg?style=flat)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cliquery)


## a command-line browser interface

cliquery cuts down on clicking through command-line web searching, page previewing, and page bookmarking, among other features. An interactive prompt allows users to easily make successive queries and enter program flags dynamically; simply typing help will list all possible flags to enter. Opening a link will invoke a browser supplied by the user or detected automatically across Windows, OSX, and Linux platforms.

## Installation
    pip install cliquery

or

    pip install git+https://github.com/huntrar/cliquery.git#egg=cliquery

or

    git clone https://github.com/huntrar/cliquery
    cd cliquery
    python setup.py install

It is recommended to [sign up](https://developer.wolframalpha.com/portal/apisignup.html) for a WolframAlpha API key and enter that and your preferred browser(s) in .cliqrc (if you do not set a browser, one will be detected automatically). An alternative method of setting your browser is with the BROWSER environment variable.

It is also recommended to create a .local.cliqrc file to use in place of .cliqrc, as .cliqrc is overwritten when updating the program.

Do the following to copy .cliqrc to .local.cliqrc:

    cd "$(dirname "$(cliquery -c)")"
    sudo cp .cliqrc .local.cliqrc

If you encounter issues installing lxml, see [here](http://lxml.de/installation.html).

Users may also import Firefox or Chrome bookmarks into .cliqrc by exporting the bookmarks to HTML and importing to cliquery with the -i flag. The imported bookmarks will be added to your existing bookmarks, which may result in duplicates.

## Usage
    usage: cliquery.py [-h] [-b] [-c] [-C] [-d] [-f] [-i [IMPORT]] [-o] [-p] [-s]
                       [-v] [-w]
                       [QUERY [QUERY ...]]

    a command-line browser interface

    positional arguments:
      QUERY                 keywords to search

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -b, --bookmark        view and modify bookmarks
      -c, --config          print config file location
      -C, --clear-cache     clear the cache
      -d, --describe        summarize links
      -f, --first           open first link
      -i [IMPORT], --import [IMPORT]
                            import bookmarks from file
      -o, --open            directly open links
      -p, --print           print links to stdout
      -s, --search          search for links
      -v, --version         display current version
      -w, --wolfram         search WolframAlpha

## Author
* Hunter Hammond (huntrar@gmail.com)

## Notes
* Supports both Python 2.x and Python 3.x.
* NOTE: If you receive the following message (or similar) when trying to modify bookmarks:

        IOError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/cliquery/.cliqrc'

    Then you have two options:

        1. (recommended) Change file ownership from root to user by entering the following:

                sudo chown $USER "$(cliquery -c)" 

        2. Execute cliquery as root, using su or sudo.
* A search may return immediate results, such as calculations or facts made possible by WolframAlpha, or instead a page of Google search results comprised of links and their descriptions.
* Interactive usage allows the user to continue making new queries by dynamically executing new program flags and/or queries. Entering h or help will list all possible prompt commands.

* To choose multiple links at once, a range may be specified by separating the start and end range with a dash. Leaving one end of the range blank will choose all links until the other end of that range. For example, given 10 links, entering 5- would effectively be the same as entering 5-10.
* Using the bookmark flag with no arguments will list all current bookmarks in .cliqrc, naturally ordered by time of entry. Entering help with the flag will list all possible commands including open, add, remove, tag/untag (for aliasing), describe, and move. Bookmarks like other flags may be entered during runtime in the link prompt.
* Additional arguments may be appended to bookmarks while opening them. These are interpreted as any non-integer arguments which are not found in any bookmarks (URLs or tags).
