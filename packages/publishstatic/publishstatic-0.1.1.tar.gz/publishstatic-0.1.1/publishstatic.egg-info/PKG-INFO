Description: publishstatic is a django management command that helps automate uploading static files to a server.  Used in conjunction with the ManifestStaticFilesStorage engine, it uploads only changed files to Amazon's S3 and Cloudfront servers.
        
        After collecting static, run ./manange.py publishstatic.  Any changed files will be uploaded to the static file server.
