        | A Python (2.7) based script for use with the Raspberry Pi Foundation
          Dots Boards and Minecraft Pi.
        | The program reads the status of the dots and generates an airplane
          inside Minecraft Pi based on the dots painted. This plane then
          attempts to fly in the game.
