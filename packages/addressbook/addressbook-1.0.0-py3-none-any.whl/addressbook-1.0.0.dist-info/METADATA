WHY BUILD ANOTHER ADDRESS BOOK?
===============================

Why build another address book?
I created this address book because I was frustrated with
current address book solutions which try to integrate
everything.  The current software-industry ( or projects )
trend towards pushing users personal information into the
cloud; is alarming, not so-much about where the data is
stored but how badly data is leaked, hacked, and compelled
( by law enforcement ) for data access. Additionally,
cloud services have let me down by corrupting data, failing
to secure data, and worst of all; deleting data when
I needed it most.

Perhaps, more simply-put, I wanted an address book that
no-one may control but me, is simple, and cloudless.

After all clouds mean rain and I've had enough of it.
So, get this address book and take control of your
data.
