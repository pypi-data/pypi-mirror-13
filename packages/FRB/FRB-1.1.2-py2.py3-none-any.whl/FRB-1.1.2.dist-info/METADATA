Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) Client
==================================================
Python client for interfacing with the Federal Reserve Bank's
FRED API. Our goal is to provide a simple, well-documented
solution for FRED-related programming in Python.

For other ways to interface with FRED in Python, see
`mortada/fredapi`_ or `zachwill/fred`_ .

.. _mortada/fredapi: https://github.com/mortada/fredapi
.. _zachwill/fred: https://github.com/zachwill/fred

.. note::

  This is a third-party client that is developed and maintained
  independently of the Federal Reserve Bank. As such, it is not
  affiliated with or supported by the institution.

Compatibility
-------------
The Federal Reserve Bank does not provide a versioned API.
We constantly monitor the API to ensure that our client is
compatible with FRED. If you notice a compatibility issue,
please let use know and we'll work to resolve the issue.

Basic usage
-------------
::

    from fred import Fred
    fr = Fred(api_key='abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456',response_type='dict')

    params = {
             'limit':2,
             'tag_names':'trade;goods'
             }

    res = fr.category.series(125,params=params)

    for record in res:
        print(record)

Features
--------

This client was built to provide users with an intuitive
and effective framework for making requests to the FRED API
from within Python. As such, our main feature is the
ability to interact with the FRED web-service.

Comprehensive query support

Popular response transformations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Transform data from http responses to your preferred format,
allowing you to focus more time on data integration and analysis
and less on response processing. If you prefer raw responses from FRED,
so that you can conduct your own response parsing, simply set ``response_type``
to *xml* or *json* (standard FRED responses). Otherwise, automatically
transform data into comma, tab, or pipe separated values,
python dictionaries, pandas dataframes, or numpy arrays.

For dictionary, dataframe, and array responses, an attempt is made to
convert data to more useful dtypes. For example, ``realtime_start``
and ``realtime_end`` response data are automatically converted
from a string to *datetime64* numpy dtype. Similarly, counts
and IDs (where appropriate) are converted to *int* while observation
measures are converted to *float*.

FRED vs. ALFRED
---------------

FRED stands for Federal Reserve Economic Data. FRED contains frequently
updated US macro and regional economic time series at annual, quarterly,
monthly, weekly, and daily frequencies.

ALFRED stands for Archival Federal Reserve Economic Data. ALFRED archives
FRED data by adding the real-time period when values were originally
released and later revised.

FRED and ALFRED use the same web-service. As noted in the `Federal Reserve Bank documentation`_,
most users are interested in FRED. As such, default parameters have been selected by the bank
to cater to FRED users. If you want to access ALFRED for a given period, simply provide
the real-time period by passing the relevant ``realtime_start`` and ``realtime_end``
parameters to the function handling your request.
