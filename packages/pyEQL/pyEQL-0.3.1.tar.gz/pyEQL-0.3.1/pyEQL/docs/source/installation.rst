Installation
************

Dependencies
============
pyEQL requires Python 3.0 or greater. For installation instructions on your system visit https://www.python.org/downloads/

In addition, you will need the following packages:

 * `pint <https://github.com/hgrecco/pint>`_
 * `scipy <http://scipy.org/>`_

See the respective pages for manual installation instructions. Alternatively, if you use pip to install pyEQL (recommended), 
they should be installed automatically.

Manually via Git
================
Simply navigate to a directory of your choice on your computer and clone the repository by executing the following terminal command:

    git clone https://github.com/rkingsbury/pyEQL

Then install by executing

    pip install -e pyEQL

Automatically via pip and PyPI
==============================

The `Python Package Index <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_ repository will allow installation to be done easily from the command line as follows:

    pip install pyEQL

This should automatically pull in the required dependencies as well.

.. note:: You may have to run 'pip3' rather than 'pip' depending on your system configuration. pyEQL works only on Python 3.
