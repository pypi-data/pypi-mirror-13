        This is an `ofxstatement`_ plugin for `Betterment`_ CSV statements downloaded
        from the site's `activity`_ page. `ofxstatement`_ converts the CSV into a
        series of "check" transactions in an OFX file, so `Moneydance`_ (for instance)
        will only consider bank and credit card accounts for the generated OFX file's
        import. Given Betterment's daily gain/loss transaction data, the "check"
        transaction type works well enough.

        `ofxstatement`_ is a tool for converting proprietary bank statements into the
        OFX format, suitable for importing into GnuCash, Moneydance, and other compatible
        applications. The plugin for ofxstatement parses a particular proprietary bank
        statement format and produces a common data structure that is then formatted
        into an OFX file.
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        As with `ofxstatement`_, this plugin requires Python 3.  You will need to have
        `ofxstatement`_ installed; the package will be brought in as a dependency if
        you install the plugin via `pip`_.
        
        .. _pip: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        You can install the plugin via most of the normal Python methods (be sure to
        install using your environment's python3 installation). Remove the `--user`
        option if you wish to install the package globally.
        
        pip
        ---
        
        ::
        
          pip3 install --user ofxstatement-betterment
        
        setup.py
        --------
        
        ::
        
          python3 setup.py install --user
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        Note that you can specify 'bank' and 'account' in ofxstatement's configuration file (accessible
        using the `ofxstatement edit-config` command or directly at
        `~/.local/share/ofxstatement/config.ini` (on Linux, at least).  Setting these values makes it
        easier for your personal finance application to recognize which account the file's data
        belongs to.
        
        Also note that transactions for zero amounts are filtered by default.  If you wish to include
        zero-amount transactions, set 'zero_filter' to 'false' in your settings.  Here is an example
        of a settings block for the betterment plugin::
        
          [betterment]
          account = 8675309
          plugin = betterment
          zero_filter = false
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Export your Betterment `activity`_ into a CSV file (it's currently `transactions.csv`). Then run::
        
          $ ofxstatement convert -t betterment transactions.csv betterment.ofx
        
        You can then import `betterment.ofx` into the personal finance application of your choice.
