django-actions-logger
=====================

A Django app that keeps a log of user actions or changes in objects

this code forked from django-auditlog and add my new ideas

Quick start
-----------

1. Add "polls" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this::

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        'actionslog',
    ]


2. Run `python manage.py migrate` to create models.
