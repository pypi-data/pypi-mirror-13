Description: # Keysmith
        
        Keysmith randomly chooses words from a list and concatenates them.
        With a sufficiently large list, these make [decent passphrases](//xkcd.com/936) that tend to be more memorable than other random passwords.
        The concept is essentially the same as (and arguably simpler than) [Diceware](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diceware).
        
        ## Installation
        
        Keysmith is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/keysmith).
        
        ``` sh
        pip install keysmith
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        Keysmith can be run as a command-line utility.
        
        ```
        $ keysmith --help
        usage: keysmith [-h] [-d DELIMITER] [-n NSAMPLES] [-p POPULATION] [--stats]
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help            show this help message and exit
          -d DELIMITER, --delimiter DELIMITER
                                a delimiter for the samples (teeth) in the key
          -n NSAMPLES, --nsamples NSAMPLES
                                the number of random samples to take
          -p POPULATION, --population POPULATION
                                alphanumeric, default, local, printable, or a path
          --stats               statistics for the key
        $ keysmith -n 4
        correct horse battery staple
        ```

        ``` python
        import string
        import keysmith
        print(keysmith.Key(seq=string.letters, nteeth=12, delimiter=''))
        ```
