        A highly experimental attempt to have a sane parser library to parse MySQL statements.
        
        At the moment - use it at your own risk!
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        * Inconsistently parses SOME SQL strings.
        
        
        How can you help?
        -----------------
        
        Read the generic ``CONTRIBUTORS.rst`` or here's a short personal
        sentiment:
        
        This is being built as a potential support for potential dba tools
        that we might write at work, so naturally certain things will be
        implemented sooner. Currently these are few use-cases we're looking
        into:
        
        * Be able to provide suggestions to `ALTER TABLE` statements (e.g.:
          announce when a statement is potentially not backwards compatible
          with code)
        * Be able to generate commands for online schema change tools.
        * Potentially add some validation support, so that an SQL linting tool
          could be written.
        
        
        Why?
        ----
        
        Out of frustration for lack of a better tool.
