Conflicts, Synchronisation, and Revisions
#########################################


Conflicts
---------

If two u1dbs are synced, and then the same document is changed in different
ways in each u1db, and then they are synced again, there will be a *conflict*.
This does not block synchronisation: the document is registered as being in
conflict, and resolving that is up to the u1db-using application.

Importantly, **conflicts are not synced**. If *machine A* initiates a sync with
*machine B*, and this sync results in a conflict, the conflict **only registers
on machine A**. This policy is sometimes called "other wins": the machine you
synced *to* wins conflicts, and the document will have machine B's content on
both machine A and machine B. However, on machine A the document is marked as
having conflicts, and must be resolved there:

.. testsetup ::

    import os, tempfile
    old_dir = os.path.realpath('.')
    tmp_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp()
    os.chdir(tmp_dir)

.. doctest ::

    >>> import u1db
    >>> db1 = u1db.open('mydb1.u1db', create=True)
    >>> db2 = u1db.open('mydb2.u1db', create=True)
    >>> doc1 = db1.create_doc({'came_from':'replica_1'})
    >>> doc_id = doc1.doc_id
    >>> # create a document in database 2 with the same document id.
    >>> doc2 = db2.create_doc({'came_from':'replica_2'}, doc_id=doc_id)
    >>> sync_target = db1.get_sync_target()
    >>> synchronizer = u1db.sync.Synchronizer(db2, sync_target)
    >>> synchronizer.sync()  # returns the local generation before sync
    1
    >>> db1_doc = db1.get_doc(doc_id)
    >>> db1_doc.content
    {u'came_from': u'replica_1'}
    >>> conflicted_doc = db2.get_doc(doc_id)
    >>> conflicted_doc.content  # the sync target's content wins
    {u'came_from': u'replica_1'}
    >>> conflicted_doc.has_conflicts # but the document is in conflict
    True
    >>> conflicts = db2.get_doc_conflicts(doc_id)
    >>> len(conflicts)  # There are two conflicting versions of the document
    2
    >>> db2.resolve_doc(conflicts[1], [d.rev for d in conflicts]) # resolve in favour db2's version
    >>> doc_is_now = db2.get_doc(doc_id)
    >>> doc_is_now.content # the content has been updated to doc's content
    {u'came_from': u'replica_2'}
    >>> db2.get_doc_conflicts(doc_id)
    []
    >>> doc_is_now.has_conflicts # and is no longer in conflict
    False
    >>> # synchronize again so that the resolved version ends up in db1
    >>> synchronizer.sync()
    3
    >>> db1_doc = db1.get_doc(doc_id)
    >>> db1_doc.content  # now is identical to db2's version
    {u'came_from': u'replica_2'}
    >>> db2_doc = db2.get_doc(doc_id)
    >>> db2_doc.has_conflicts  # this sync did not create any new conflicts
    False

.. testcleanup ::

    os.chdir(old_dir)
    os.remove(os.path.join(tmp_dir, "mydb1.u1db"))
    os.remove(os.path.join(tmp_dir, "mydb2.u1db"))
    os.rmdir(tmp_dir)

Note that ``put_doc`` will fail because we got conflicts from a sync, but it
may also fail for another reason. If you acquire a document before a sync and
then sync, and the sync updates that document, then re-putting that document
with modified content will also fail, because the revision is not the current
one. This will raise a ``RevisionConflict`` error.

Synchronisation
---------------

Synchronisation between two u1db replicas consists of the following steps:

1. The source replica asks the target replica for the information it has
   stored about the last time these two replicas were synchronised (if
   ever).

2. The source replica validates that its information regarding the last
   synchronisation is consistent with the target's information, and
   raises an error if not. (This could happen for instance if one of the
   replicas was lost and restored from backup, or if a user inadvertently
   tries to synchronise a copied database.)

3. The source replica generates a list of changes since the last change the
   target replica knows of.

4. The source replica checks what the last change is it knows about on the
   target replica.

5. If there have been no changes on either replica that the other side has
   not seen, the synchronisation stops here.

6. The source replica sends the changed documents to the target, along with
   what the latest change is that it knows about on the target replica.

7. The target processes the changed documents, and records the source
   replica's latest change.

8. The target responds with the documents that have changes that the source
   does not yet know about.

9. The source processes the changed documents, and records the target
   replica's latest change.

10. If the source has seen no changes unrelated to the synchronisation
    during this whole process, it now sends the target what its latest
    change is, so that the next synchronisation does not have to consider
    changes that were the result of this one.

The synchronisation information stored by the replica for each other replica it
has ever synchronised with consists of:

* The replica id of the other replica. (Which should be globally unique
  identifier to distinguish database replicas from one another.)
* The last known generation and transaction id of the other replica.
* The generation and transaction id of *this* replica at the time of the
  most recent succesfully completed synchronisation with the other replica.

Any change to any document in a database constitutes a transaction. Each
transaction increases the database generation by 1, and u1db implementations
should [#]_ assign a transaction id, which is meant to be a unique random string
paired with each generation, that can be used to detect the case where replica
A and replica B have previously synchronised at generation N, and subsequently
replica B is somehow reverted to an earlier generation (say, a restore from
backup, or somebody made a copy of the database file of replica B at generation
< N, and tries to synchronise that), and then new changes are made to it.  It
could end up at generation N again, but with completely different data.  Having
random unique transaction ids will allow replica A to detect this situation,
and refuse to synchronise to prevent data loss. (Lesson to be learned from
this: do not copy databases around, that is what synchronisation is for.)


Synchronisation Over HTTP
-------------------------

Synchronisation over HTTP is tuned to minimize the number of request/response
round trips. The anatomy of a full synchronisation over HTTP is as follows:

1. The application wishing to synchronise sends the following GET request
   to the server::

        GET /thedb/sync-from/my_replica_uid

   Where ``thedb`` is the name of the database to be synchronised, and
   ``my_replica_uid`` is the replica id of the application's (i.e. the
   local, or synchronisation source) database.

2. The target responds with a JSON document that looks like this::

        {
            "target_replica_uid": "other_replica_uid",
            "target_replica_generation": 12,
            "target_replica_transaction_id": "T-sdkfj92292j",
            "source_replica_uid": "my_replica_uid",
            "source_replica_generation": 23,
            "source_transaction_id": "T-39299sdsfla8"
        }

   With all the information it has stored for the most recent
   synchronisation between itself and this particular source replica. In
   this case it tells us that the synchronisation target believes that when
   it and the source were last synchronised, the target was at generation
   12 and the source at generation 23.

3. If source and target agree on the above information, the source now
   starts a streaming POST request to the same URL::

        POST /thedb/sync-from/my_replica_uid

   The request is of MIME type ``application/x-u1db-sync-stream``, which is
   a subset of JSON. The format is a JSON array with a JSON object on each
   line, followed by a comma and a carriage return and a newline, like
   this::

        [\r\n
        {json_object},\r\n
        ...
        ]

   The first object contains the following information::

        {"last_known_generation": 12, "last_known_trans_id": "T-39299sdsfla8"},\r\n

   and then for each document that it has changes for that are more recent
   than generation 23, ordered by generation in ascending order, it sends,
   on a single line, followed by a comma and a newline character, the
   following JSON object::

        {"id": "mydocid", "rev": "my_replica_uid:4", "content": "{}", "generation": 48, "trans_id": "T-88djlahhhd"},\r\n

   .. note::
       Note that content contains a JSON encoded representation of the
       document's content (which in this case is empty).

   The server reads and processes these lines one by one. Note that each
   such JSON document includes the generation and transaction id of the
   change. This means that when the synchronisation is ever interrupted,
   the source can resume by starting at the last generation that was
   successfully synchronised.

4. After it gets to the end of the request, the server responds with a
   status 200 and starts streaming a response, also of MIME type
   ``application/x-u1db-sync-stream``, which starts as follows::

        [\r\n
        {"new_generation": 15, "new_transaction_id": "T-999j3jjsfl"},\r\n

   which tells the source what the target's new generation and transaction
   id are, now that it processed the changes it received from the source.
   Then it starts streaming  *its* changes since its last generation that
   was synced (12 in this case), in exactly the same format (and order) as
   the source did in step 3.

5. When the source has processed all the changes it received from the
   target, *and* it detects that there have been no changes to its database
   since the start of the synchronisation that were not a direct result
   *of* the synchronisation, it now performs a final PUT request, to inform
   the target of its new generation and transaction id, so that the next
   synchronisation can start there, rather than with the generation the
   source was at when this synchronisation started::

        PUT /thedb/sync-from/my_replica_uid

   With the content::

        {"generation": 53, "transaction_id": "T-camcmls92"}


Revisions
---------

As an app developer, you should treat a ``Document``'s ``revision`` as an
opaque cookie; do not try and deconstruct it or edit it. It is for your u1db
implementation's use. You can therefore ignore the rest of this section.

If you are writing a new u1db implementation, understanding revisions is
important, and this is where you find out about them.

To keep track of document revisions u1db uses vector clocks. Each
synchronised instance of the same database is called a replica and has a unique
identifier (``replica uid``) assigned to it (currently the reference
implementation by default uses UUID4s for that); a revision is a mapping
between ``replica uids`` and ``revisions``, as follows: ``rev
= <replica_uid:revision...>``, or using a functional notation
``rev(replica_uid) = revision``. The current concrete format is a string
built out of each ``replica_uid`` concatenated with ``':'`` and with its
revision in decimal, sorted lexicographically by ``replica_uid`` and then all
joined with ``'|'``, for example: ``'replicaA:1|replicaB:3'`` . Absent
``replica uids`` in a revision mapping are implicitly mapped to revison 0.

The new revision of a document modified locally in a replica, is the
modification of the old revision where the revision mapped to the editing
``replica uid`` is increased by 1.

When syncing one needs to establish whether an incoming revision is newer than
the current one or in conflict. A revision

``rev1 = <replica_1i:revision1i|i=1..n>``

is newer than a different

``rev2 = <replica_2j:revision2j|j=1..m>``

if for all ``i=1..n``, ``rev2(replica_1i) <= revision1i``

and for all ``j=1..m``, ``rev1(replica_2j) >= revision2j``.

Two revisions which are not equal nor one newer than the other are in conflict.

When resolving a conflict locally in a replica ``replica_resol``, starting from
``rev1...revN`` in conflict, the resulting revision ``rev_resol`` is obtained
by:

     ``R`` is the set the of all replicas explicitly mentioned in ``rev1..revN``

     ``rev_resol(r) = max(rev1(r)...revN(r))`` for all ``r`` in ``R``, with ``r != rev_resol``

     ``rev_resol(replica_resol) = max(rev1(replica_resol)...revN(replica_resol))+1``

.. rubric:: footnotes

.. [#] Implementations are not required to use transaction ids. If they don't
       they should return an empty string when asked for a transaction id. All
       implementations should accept an empty string as a valid transaction id.
       We suggest to implement transaction ids where possible though, since
       omitting them can lead to data loss in scenarios like the ones described
       above.
