======================
Eliza Chatbot Client
======================

This package is released in the context of Re-WoChat: Workshop on Collecting
and Generating Resources for Chatbots and Conversational Agents - Development
and Evaluation as part of the shared task.

   link: http://workshop.colips.org/re-wochat/shared.html

The goal of the shared task is to collect data and annotations from
human-machine and human-human dialogues annotated by the participants.
Human-machine dialogues will be generated by using different online
and offline chat engines, and annotations are to be generated following a
provided set of guidelines. The collected dataset will be made publicly
available to the research community for further research and experimentation
in future editions of the workshop.

In this context, the organizing committee releases this chatbot which works
as a stand-alone application and generates a log file with the interactions
with the users. The generated log is finally converted into a XML file that,
participants must submit, together with the log file, to the organizers.
