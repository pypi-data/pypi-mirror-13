## What is this?
This is a small library which gets all GitHub users given a city. Original idea is [Top-GitHub-Users-Data](https://github.com/JJ/top-github-users-data) by [@JJ](https://github.com/JJ), an adaptation of [top-github-users](https://github.com/paulmillr/top-github-users) from [@paulmillr](https://github.com/paulmillr/).

## What I can do with this?
Now, you only can get all user names from a city (with a city in the location field). In future, this will be an amazing library.

## What I need to run this?
You will need to install Python 3. Python 2 is not supported. I recommend you [install Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/).

In addition, you will need to get ID and Secret from a GitHub application. [You can register your own application here!](https://github.com/settings/applications/new).

#### Dependences
You have a ``requeriments.txt`` file. Install all dependences with ``pip install -r requeriments.txt``. You can use too "setup.py".


## Getting started
#### Basic example
```python
nameCity = "Granada"
idGH = "asdadfs5ds8sdfsdf8c" #GitHub ID
secretGH = "asdad45asfsdf8vdfg8sdfgv" #Github Secret

city = GitHubCity(idGH, secretGH, config=None,locations=["Granada", "Graná"], city="Granada",
excludedUsers=["noninaperson"], excludedLocations=["México"], debug=True)

city.getCityUsers()
city.
```

#### Configuration file

```json
{
    "excludedLocations": [
        "Granada"
    ],
    "excludedUsers": [
        "peter"
    ],
    "intervals": [
        [
            "2008-01-01",
            "2015-12-24"
        ]
    ],
    "last_date": "2015-12-24",
    "locations": [
        "Granada"
    ],
    "name": "Granada"
}
```
