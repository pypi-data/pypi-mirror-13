# This Nagios plugin may be used to check the health of an RDP server, such
# as a Windows host offering remote desktop. Typically, a "strange" RDP
# response is a good indication of a Windows host is having trouble (while
# it is still responding to ping).

# It seems that the RDP protocol is based on a protocol called X.224,
# and this plugin only goes as far as checking very basic X.224
# protocol operations. Hence, the somewhat strange name of the plugin.

# Example of a check command definition, using this plugin:
# define command{
#         command_name    check_x224
#         command_line    /usr/local/nagios/check_x224 -H $HOSTADDRESS$
#         }
#
# A corresponding service definition might look like:
# define service{
#         service_description             Remote desktop
#         check_command                   check_x224
#         host_name                       somename.example.com
#         use                             generic-service
#         }
