Description: K2ephem |Travis status|
        =======================
        
        ***Checks whether a Solar System body is (or was) observable by `NASA's
        K2 mission <http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov>`__.***
        
        The `JPL/Horizons <http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.cgi>`__ ephemeris
        service allows users to predict the position of Solar System bodies in
        the sky as seen from the Kepler/K2 spacecraft. This can be achieved by
        entering ``@-227`` as the "Observer Location". (Setting the location to
        be the Kepler spacecraft is *crucial*, because Kepler is more than 0.5
        AU away from the Earth!)
        
        This repository provides a command-line tool that uses the JPL/Horizons
        service to check whether a Solar System body is (or was) in the
        footprint of one of the past or future K2 Campaign fields.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        You need to have a working version of Python installed. If this
        requirement is met, you can install ``K2ephem`` from the git repository
        as follows:
        
        ::
        
            $ git clone https://github.com/KeplerGO/K2ephem.git
            $ cd K2ephem
            $ python setup.py install
        
        The ``setup.py`` script will automatically take care of installing two
        required dependencies (``K2fov`` and ``pandas``).
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        After installation, you can call ``K2ephem`` from the command line. For
        example, to verify whether comet *Chiron* can be observed by K2, simply
        type:
        
        ::
        
            K2ephem Chiron
