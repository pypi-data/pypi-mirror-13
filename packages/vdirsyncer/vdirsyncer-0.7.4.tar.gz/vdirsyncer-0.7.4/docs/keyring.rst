Storing passwords
=================

.. versionchanged:: 0.7.0

   Password configuration got completely overhauled.

Vdirsyncer can fetch passwords from several sources other than the config file.

Command
=======

Say you have the following configuration::

    [storage foo]
    type = caldav
    url = ...
    username = foo
    password = bar

But it bugs you that the password is stored in cleartext in the config file.
You can do this::

    [storage foo]
    type = caldav
    url = ...
    username = foo
    password.fetch = ["command", "~/get-password.sh", "more", "args"]

You can fetch the username as well::

    [storage foo]
    type = caldav
    url = ...
    username.fetch = ["command", "~/get-username.sh"]
    password.fetch = ["command", "~/get-password.sh"]

Or really any kind of parameter in a storage section.

System Keyring
==============

While the command approach is quite flexible, it is often cumbersome to write a
script fetching the system keyring.

Vdirsyncer can do this for you if you have the keyring_ package installed. How
you would obtain this package depends on how you installed vdirsyncer. If you
used pip, you can use the following command to also install keyring::

    pip install vdirsyncer[keyring]

Then you can use::

    [storage foo]
    type = caldav
    username = myusername
    password.fetch = ["keyring", "myservicename", "myusername"]


The password can than be set like this (in a python interpreter)::

   >>> import keyring
   >>> keyring.set_password("myservicename", "myusername", "password")
  
To test if you got it right you can run::
  
   >>> keyring.get_password("myservicename", "myusername")
   "password"
  
.. _keyring: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/keyring


Password Prompt
===============

You can also simply prompt for the password::

    [storage foo]
    type = caldav
    username = myusername
    password.fetch = ["prompt", "Password for CalDAV"]
