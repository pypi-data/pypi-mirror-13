        Installation
        ------------
        - Activate the virtualenv where you installed Mayan EDMS.
        - Install from PyPI::
        
            pip install mayan-document_renaming
        
        In your settings/local.py file add `document_renaming` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` list::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS += (
                'document_renaming',
            )
        
        Run the migrations for the app::
        
            mayan-edms.py migrate
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        - Create a sequence.
        - Create a renaming template a document type using Django's templating language and referencing a sequence's `.next_value` method.
        
        Example::
        
            Invoice-{{ sequence_invoice.next_value|stringformat:"05d" }}
        
        This will rename a new document as "Invoice-0000". A subsequent document will be renamed as "Invoice-0001" and so on.
        
        
        Development
        -----------

            INSTALLED_APPS += (
                'document_renaming',
            )
