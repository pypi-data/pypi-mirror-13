0.2.4 (Feb. 1, 2016)

    * Indeterminate ProgressBar now animates properly on Windows.

0.2.3 (Jan. 31, 2016)

    * ProgressBar now renders anything 100% or more full as exactly 100% full.
    * Fixed bug in ProgressBar that it wouldn't update with heavy CPU load.

0.2.2 (Jan. 30, 2016)

    * Created ProgressBar class. Takes a maximum value and length. Has a step
                                 method. Set maximum to 0 for indeterminate.
                                 Pretty simple. Still doesn't warrant a 0.3.0.

0.2.1 (Jan. 27, 2016)

    * Created Label class. Takes an initial (optional) value. Has a set method.
                           Pretty simple. Doesn't warrant numbering this 0.3.0.

0.2.0 (Jan. 23, 2016)

    * Created Menu class. It's a non-native alternative to Tk's Menu class
                          which is easier to control/mix with other Tk elements.
    * Created Popup class. Easy way to display secondary, floating, featureless
                           windows. The Menu class utilizes them.
    * Created event concept. Anything marked with the @event decorator can be
                             observed in any of the following ways:
                             1 - By subclasses, as always.
                             2 - By whatever is assigned to instance.delegate.
                             3 - By calling bind<name of event>(functionToCall)
    * Entry class has the events: onChange, onReturn, onUp,
                                  onDown,   onFocus,  onFocusLost.
    * Menu  class has the events: onHighlight, onSelect.
