    "As you can see, HoloViews lets you compose objects of heterogenous types, and objects covering many different numerical or other dimensions, laying them out spatially or as overlays where appropriate.  The resulting data structures are complex, but they are composed of simple elements with well-defined interactions, making it feasible to express nearly any relationship that will characterize your data.  In practice, you will probably not need this many levels, but given this complete example, you should be able to construct an appropriate organization for whatever type of data that you do want to organize or visualize. \n",
    "\n",
    "As emphasized above, it is not possible to combine these objects in other orderings.  Of course, any ``Element`` can be substituted for any other, which doesn't change the structure.  But you cannot e.g. have an ``Overlay`` or ``HoloMap`` of ``Layout`` objects.  Confusingly, the objects may *act* as if you have these arrangements.  For instance, a ``Layout`` of ``HoloMap`` objects will be animated, like ``HoloMap`` objects, but only because of the extra dimension(s) provided by the enclosed ``HoloMap`` objects, not because the ``Layout`` itself has data along those dimensions.  Similarly, you cannot have a ``Layout`` of ``Layout`` objects, even though it looks like you can.  E.g. the ``+`` operator on two ``Layout`` objects will not create a ``Layout`` of ``Layout`` objects; it just creates a new ``Layout`` object containing the data from both of the other objects.  Similarly for the ``Overlay`` of ``Overlay`` objects using ``*``; only a single combined ``Overlay`` is returned.\n",
