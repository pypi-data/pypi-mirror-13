    "To explain how to select and transform HoloViews Elements to summarize them or to rearrange the data, we first have to explore what kind of data each Element can hold. Different Element types represent discrete and continuous spaces of different dimensionality.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Discrete samples in continuous spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "**1D**: ``Curve``, ``Scatter``, ``ErrorBars``, ``Spread``\n",
    "\n",
    "These Elements usually represented a discretely sampled, continuous, indepent variable plotted against a discrete or  continuously sampled dependent variable.\n",

    "* indexing     : Selecting a single data value\n",
    "* table/dframe : Converts any Element or ``UniformNdMapping`` type into a ``Table`` or pandas dataframe.\n",
