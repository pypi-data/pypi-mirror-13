========================
A Jupyter Kernel for Tcl
========================

This uses the version of Tcl that comes with Python, through Tkinter, so you do not need to install anything else.

Not packaged up to pip yet, so to test out, clone the repository::

    pip3 install tcl_kernel
    python3 -m tcl_kernel.install
    
To use try one of these::

    jupyter notebook
    # Then select the Tcl option in the 'New' section
    jupyter qtconsole --kernel tcl
    jupyter console --kernel tcl


For details of how this works, see the Jupyter docs on `wrapper kernels
<http://jupyter-client.readthedocs.org/en/latest/wrapperkernels.html>`_, and

Huge thanks to Thomas Kluyver (@takluyver) who's `Jupyter bash kernel <https://github.com/takluyver/bash_kernel>`_ I 
made heavy use of to get this working. Also to Eli Bendersky whose code in the blogpost
`Redirecting all kinds of stdout in Python <http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2015/redirecting-all-kinds-of-stdout-in-python/>`_ was very useful for this.
