Description: This is an automated checker to make sure a C++ file follows Google's C++ style
        guide (https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html). As it heavily relies
        on regular expressions, cpplint.py won't catch all violations of the style
        guide and will very occasionally report a false positive. There is a list of
        things we currently don't handle very well at the top of cpplint.py, and we
        welcome patches to improve it.
        
        This version includes some fixes and additional features. For the original
        Google version, see https://github.com/google/styleguide/.
