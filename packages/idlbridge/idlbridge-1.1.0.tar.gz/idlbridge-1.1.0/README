IDLBridge
=========

A python wrapper for the IDL.

After exploring the various options available on the internet (pyidl, pyidlrpc,
pidly) we have found that none of them have the feature sets we need to provide
an effective migration tool from IDL to python. These packages are either
unmaintained (don't support python 3), are slow or use access routines that are
impractical for multi-user systems (IDLRPC).

This is a simple IDL bridge library that interacts via the IDL "callable"
library interface.

The high level python interface is designed to hide the IDL calls behind python
objects such that the IDL calls can be transparently replaced at a later date
without requiring significant code refactoring.
