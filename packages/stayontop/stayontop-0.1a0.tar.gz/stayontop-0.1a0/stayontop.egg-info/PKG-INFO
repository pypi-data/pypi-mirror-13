        ===========================================
        
        Development instances on AWS EC2 need to be shutdown off-hours.
        
        This small project tries to address this need providing a clear config file in yaml.
        
          - You can specify which instances must be stopped/running all the time.
          - By default all instances are set to be stopped off-hours
          - You can set all instances with a specific project tag to be open
          - Assumes office hours are between 07:00 - 19:00
          - Assumes EC2 instance tags: "project"
          - Assumes EC2 instance name matches  instance tag "Name"
        
        A sample config file:
        
        ::
        
                global:
                   restricted:
                      projects:
                            - BI
                            - CRM
                            - PUSHAPP
                   keep_running:
                      instances:
                            - sybase.acme.com
                            - hana01.acme.com
                   keep_stopped:
                      instances:
                            - sybase.acme.com
                            - hanadyn.acme.com
                            - apush.acme.com
                   weekend_on:
                      projects:
                            - BI
                   aws_boto_profile: SYS
        
        Use case #1: Please keep FMS project stopped at weekends
           - Do not put it on weekend_on anywhere in the config
           - By default all projects are stopped unless stated otherwise
           - With the following config SAP project instances will be running during weekends
        
        ::
        
           global:
              weekend_on:
                 projects:
                      - SAP
        
        
        Use case #2:  I want webdev01 instance to be running this night
        ::
        
           date_of_today:
              keep_running:
                  instances:
                     - webdev01
        
        
        Use case #3:  Please keep webdev01 instance stopped on off-hours
            - Unless stated otherwise all instances are stopped on off-hours
        
        
        Use case #4: Please keep dbdev01 instance stopped on working hours
        ::
        
            global:
                keep_stopped:
                     instances:
                         - dbdev01
        
        
        Use case #5:  Please keep dbdev01 instance stopped on 29.12.2015
           - Add the following to the config
           - Remove from the global config if necessary
        
        ::
        
             29.12.2015:
                 keep_stopped:
                      instances:
                          - dbdev01
