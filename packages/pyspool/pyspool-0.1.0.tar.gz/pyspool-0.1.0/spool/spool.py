    Class that contains all Spool methods.

    In the SPOOL implementation there is no notion of users only addresses.
    All addresses come from BIP32 HD wallets. This makes it easier to manage all the keys
    since we can retrieve everything we need from a master secret (namely the private key
    to sign the transactions).

    Since we are dealing with HD wallets we expect all from_address to be a tuple of (path, address)
    so that we can retrieve the private key for that particular leaf address.
    If we want to use the root address we can just pass an empty string to the first element of the
    tuple e.g. ('', address). For instance when using the federation wallet address we have no
    need to create leaf addresses.

    A file is represented by two hashes:
        - file_hash: is the hash of the digital file
        - file_hash_metadata: is the hash of the digital file + metadata
    The hash is passed to the methods has a tuple (file_hash, file_hash_metadata)

        constructs the transaction.

        :param from_address: Address originating the the transaction
        :param to: list of addresses to receive tokens (file_hash, file_hash_metadata, ...)
        :param op_return: String representation of the spoolverb, as returned by the properties of Spoolverb
        :param min_confirmations: Number of confirmations when chosing the inputs of the transaction. Defaults to 6
        :return: unsigned transaction
