libgen-python-api
=================

A Python library that provides an api to search and get links from
Books,Magazines,Comics,... from Library Genesis.

Requirements:
-------------

-  Python 3
-  Grab library and it's dependencies.

Example of usage:
-----------------

    import libgenapi

    lg=libgenapi.Libgenapi(["http://[INSERT MIRROR DOMAIN 1
    HERE].com","http://[INSERT MIRROR DOMAIN 2 HERE].com]) # You can add
    as many mirrors as you want.

    lg.search("python")

Then the results are something like this (but... without the crazyness
:P real links and titles...):

::
