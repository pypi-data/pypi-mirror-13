Description: # nanonispy
        
        A small library written in python 3 to parse Nanonis binary and ascii files. 
        
        ## Requirements
        
        Currently written and 'tested' with python 3.5, fairly sure this won't work with version of python < 3.0
        
        - numpy (>1.10)
        
        Will continue making tests that are actually useful and maybe will make this a conda/pip build.
        
        ## Basic usage
        
        Once installed, you should be able to import it to any python script or ipython session.
        
        ```python
        import nanonispy as nap
        ```
        
        Then given a file,
        
        ```python
        grid = nap.read.Grid('/path/to/datafile.3ds')
        ```
        
        You can look at the attributes and methods to determine the information available. 
        
        ## Running tests
        If you have the nose module installed, it's as simple as 
        ```python
        nosetests
        ```
        .
        
        You can also see coverage of the tests as well as ignore the test discovery of numpy core packages (don't quite understand why it does this) with
        ```python
        nosetests --with-coverage --cover-branches --cover-package=nanonispy
        ```
        .
        
        *I don't know how to turn tests without nose...*
        
        ## To do
        - homogenize grid and scan header keys, right now header formats are pretty different and I'm to lazy to do it myself.
