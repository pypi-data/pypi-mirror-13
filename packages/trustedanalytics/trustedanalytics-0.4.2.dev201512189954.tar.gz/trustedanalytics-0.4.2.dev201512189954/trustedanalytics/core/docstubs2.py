            Create a 'new' instance of a k-means model.

        k-means [1]_ is an unsupervised algorithm used to partition
        the data into 'k' clusters.
        Each observation can belong to only one cluster, the cluster with the nearest
        mean.
        The k-means model is initialized, trained on columns of a frame, and used to
        predict cluster assignments for a frame.
        This model runs the MLLib implementation of k-means [2]_ with enhanced
        features, computing the number of elements in each cluster during training.
        During predict, it computes the distance of each observation from its cluster
        center and also from every other cluster center.

            Create a 'new' instance of a Support Vector Machine model.

        Support Vector Machine [1]_ is a supervised algorithm used to
        perform binary classification.
        A support vector machine constructs a high dimensional hyperplane which is
        said to achieve a good separation when a hyperplane has the largest distance to
        the nearest training-data point of any class. This model runs the
        LIBSVM [2]_ [3]_ implementation of SVM.
        The LIBSVM model is initialized, trained on columns of a frame, used to
        predict the labels of observations in a frame and used to test the predicted
        labels against the true labels.
        During testing, labels of the observations are predicted and tested against
        the true labels using built-in binary Classification Metrics.

            Create a 'new' instance of a Naive Bayes model

        Naive Bayes [1]_ is a probabilistic classifier with strong
        independence assumptions between features.
        It computes the conditional probability distribution of each feature given label,
        and then applies Bayes' theorem to compute the conditional probability
        distribution of a label given an observation, and use it for prediction.
        The Naive Bayes model is initialized, trained on columns of a frame, tested against true labels of a frame and used
        to predict the value of the dependent variable given the independent
        observations of a frame and test the performance of the classification on test data.
        This model runs the MLLib implementation of Naive Bayes [2]_.

        Power Iteration Clustering [1]_ is a scalable and efficient algorithm for clustering vertices of a graph given pairwise similarities as edge properties.

        The Random Forest Classifier model is initialized, trained on columns of a

        predicted labels against the true labels.
        This model runs the MLLib implementation of Random Forest [2]_.
        During training, the decision trees are trained in parallel.
        During prediction, each tree's prediction is counted as vote for one class.
        The label is predicted to be the class which receives the most votes.
        During testing, labels of the observations are predicted and tested against the true labels
        using built-in binary and multi-class Classification Metrics.

            Create a 'new' instance of a Support Vector Machine model.

        Support Vector Machine [1]_ is a supervised algorithm used to
        perform binary classification.
        A Support Vector Machine constructs a high dimensional hyperplane which is
        said to achieve a good separation when a hyperplane has the largest distance
        to the nearest training-data point of any class.
        This model runs the MLLib implementation of SVM [2]_ with SGD [3]_ optimizer.
        The SVMWithSGD model is initialized, trained on columns of a frame, used to
        predict the labels of observations in a frame, and tests the predicted labels
        against the true labels.
        During testing, labels of the observations are predicted and tested against
        the true labels using built-in binary Classification Metrics.
