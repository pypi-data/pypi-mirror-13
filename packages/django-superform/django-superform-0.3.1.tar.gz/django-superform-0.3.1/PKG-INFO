        ================
        
        **Less sucking formsets.**

        A ``SuperForm`` is absolutely super if you want to nest a lot of forms in each
        other. Use formsets and nested forms inside the ``SuperForm``. The
        ``SuperForm`` will take care of its children!
        
        .. note::
            This package is still in rapid development. Some APIs might change in the
            future and it's not yet feature complete. The documentation is not yet
            complete either, but everything that is documented, is up to date and
            should work as stated. If not, then please file a bug.
            Every non-backwards compatible change and new features will be documented
            in the changelog_.
        
        .. _changelog: https://github.com/gregmuellegger/django-superform/tree/master/CHANGES.rst
        
        Imagine you want to have a view that shows and validates a form and a formset.
        Let's say you have a signup form where users can enter multiple email
        addresses. Django provides formsets_ for this usecase, but handling those in a
        view is usually quite troublesome. You need to validate both the form and the
        formset manually and you cannot use django's generic FormView_. So here comes
        **django-superform** into play.
        
        .. _formsets: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/topics/forms/formsets/
        .. _FormView: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/ref/class-based-views/generic-editing/#formview
        
        Here we have an example for the usecase. Let's have a look at the
        ``forms.py``:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from django import forms
            from django_superform import SuperModelForm, InlineFormSetField
            from myapp.models import Account, Email
        
        
            class EmailForm(forms.ModelForm):
                class Meta:
                    model = Email
                    fields = ('account', 'email',)
        
        
            EmailFormSet = modelformset_factory(EmailForm)
        
        
            class SignupForm(SuperModelForm):
                username = forms.CharField()
                # The model `Email` has a ForeignKey called `user` to `Account`.
                emails = InlineFormSetField(formset_class=EmailFormSet)
        
                class Meta:
                    model = Account
                    fields = ('username',)
        
        
        So we assign the ``EmailFormSet`` as a field directly to the ``SignupForm``.
        That's where it belongs! Ok and how do I handle this composite form in the
        view? Have a look:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            def post_form(request):
                if request.method == 'POST':
                    form = PostForm(request.POST)
                    if form.is_valid():
                        account = form.save()
                        return HttpResponseRedirect('/success/')
                else:
                    form = PostForm()
                return render_to_response('post_form.html', {
                    'form',
                }, context_instance=RequestContext(request))
        
        
        No, we don't do anything different as we would do without having the
        ``FormSet`` on the ``SignupForm``. That way you are free to implement all the
        logic in the form it self where it belongs and use generic views like
        ``CreateView`` you would use them with simple forms. Want an example for this?
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from django.views.generic import CreateView
            from myapp.models import Account
            from myapp.forms import SignupForm
        
        
            class SignupView(CreateView):
                model = Account
                form_class = SignupForm
        
        
            urlpatterns = patterns('',
                url('^signup/$', SignupView.as_view()),
            )
        
        And it just works.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.3.1
        -----
        
        * ``SuperForm.composite_fields`` dict is not longer shared between form
          instances. Every new form instances get's a deep copy. So changes to it
          won't leak into other instances of the same form class.
        
        0.3.0
        -----
        
        * `#11`_: Fix ``CompositeBoundField`` to allow direct access to nested form
          fields via ``form['nested_form']['field']``.
        * Support for Django's Media handling in nested forms. See `#3`_ and `#5`_.
        * Do not populate errorlist representations without any errors of nested
          formsets into the errors of the super form. See `#5`_ for details.
        
        .. _#3: https://github.com/gregmuellegger/django-superform/issues/3
        .. _#5: https://github.com/gregmuellegger/django-superform/pull/5
        .. _#11: https://github.com/gregmuellegger/django-superform/issues/11
        
        0.2.0
        -----
        
        * Django 1.8 support.
        * Initial values given to the ``__init__`` method of the super-form will get
          passed through to the nested forms.
        * The ``empty_permitted`` argument for modelforms used in a ``ModelFormField``
          is set depending on the ``required`` attribute given to the field.
        
        0.1.0
        -----
        
        * Initial release with proof of concept.
