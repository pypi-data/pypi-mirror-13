======

Posts is a Python library for send mail easily.

Installation
------------

- ``GitHub:`` https://github.com/importcjj/Posts
- ``PyPi`` https://pypi.python.org/pypi/posts

.. code:: sh

	pip install posts

Examples
--------

Here is the first one to send a mail in **text**:

.. code:: python

	from posts import Posts

	mail = Posts('smtp-server', 'your-username', 'your-passwd')

	with mail() as box:
		box.text('to_address', subject='Subject', content='Content')


Posts does not only support mail in **text** type, but also support **html**:

.. code:: python

	box.html('to_address', subject='Subject', content='Content')


Next, we can send a mail with **attachments**:

.. code:: python

	with mail() as box:
		box.attach({'example.jpg': './example.jpg})
		box.text('to_address')


Finally, we can send the mail in html type with image:

.. code:: python

	with mail(alias='alias') as box:
		box.attach({
				'example.jpg': './example.jpg'})
		box.html(
			recipient='to_address', 
			subject='subject', 
			content='<img src="cid:example.jpg">')


Maybe you need to send mail by ssl, don't worry:

.. code:: python

	with mail(ssl=True) as box:
		box.text('to_address')

Chain Useage
------------

Just try like this:

.. code:: python

	box.attach(**kwargs).\
		attach(**kwargs).\
		text(**kwargs)
