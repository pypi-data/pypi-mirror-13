License: MIT License
Description: 
    ### Features

     * Python 2 and 3 compatible
     * Automatic correction of
       * Linefeeds according to patched file
       * Diffs broken by stripping trailing whitespace
       * a/ and b/ prefixes
     * Single file, which is a command line tool and a library
     * No dependencies outside Python stdlib
     * Patch format detection (SVN, HG, GIT)
     * Nice diffstat histogram
     * Linux / Windows / OS X
     * Test coverage

    Things that don't work out of the box:

     * File renaming, creation and removal
     * Directory tree operations
     * Version control specific properties
     * Non-unified diff formats


    ### Usage

    Download **patch.py** and run it with Python. It is a self-contained
    module without external dependencies.

        patch.py diff.patch

    You can also run the .zip file.
        
        python patch-1.15.zip diff.patch

    ### Installation

    **patch.py** is self sufficient. You can copy it into your repository
    and use it from here. This setup will always be repeatable. But if
    you need to add `patch` module as a dependency, make sure to use strict
    specifiers to avoid hitting an API break:

        pip install "patch>=1,<2"

    With pip 6.x.x and later it is possible to use the alternative syntax:

        pip install "patch==1.*"
