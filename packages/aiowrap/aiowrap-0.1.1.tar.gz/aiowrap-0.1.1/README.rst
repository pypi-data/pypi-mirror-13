aiowrap
=======

Simple example
--------------

Assume that you have some existing libraries with blocking methods::

    def foo_sync(x, a, b):
        """Some existing library methods. Sleeps for x seconds and returns a + b."""
        time.sleep(x)
        return a + b

And you are writing a program in Python3's `asyncio` framework. To use the
blocking library, one way is to use a thread pool. This library provides
another option::

    # Wraps foo_sync() into foo_async() to use in asyncio framework.
    time.sleep = aiowrap.wrap_async(asyncio.sleep)
    foo_async = aiowrap.wrap_sync(foo_sync)

Now you have an asynchronous, non-blocking version of the method, you can call
it inside your favourite coroutine::

    async def main():
        print(await foo_async(1, 2, 3))

The source code of this example can be found at `example/sleep.py`.
