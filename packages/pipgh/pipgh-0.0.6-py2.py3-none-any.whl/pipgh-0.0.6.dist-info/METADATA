A tool to install python packages from Github.

    Why can't we use Github as a means to share our Python code directly?

*pipgh* searches and installs Python packages from Github. You can further cite a specific branch, release or commit's hash value. This makes the deployment of your Python package as simple as a commit to your repository. (Yup, that means no more wasting of your time!)

Pure Python code (2 and 3 compatible).
