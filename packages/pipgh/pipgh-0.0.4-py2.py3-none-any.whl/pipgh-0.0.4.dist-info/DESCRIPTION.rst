pipgh allows searching for Python packages on Github and installing them directly. It further allows to specify a reference to a branch, a release or a commit's hash value.

pipgh works with common HTTP GET requests. This simplicity makes it a great solution to deploy software with dependencies available on Github, without the need to install a Version Control System client on the users' system.

Pure Python code (2 and 3 compatible). No dependencies.
