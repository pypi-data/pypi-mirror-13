        v0.0.5
        
        ![Cumulative Blame Stravalib](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wdm0006/git-pandas/master/examples/img/stravalib_cumulative_blame.png)
        
        A simple set of wrappers around gitpython for creating pandas dataframes out of git data. The project is centered around
        two primary objects:
        
         * Repository
         * ProjectDirectory
         
        A Repository object contains a single git repo, and is used to interact with it.  A ProjectDirectory references a directory
        in your filesystem which may have in it multiple git repositories. The subdirectories are all walked to find any child
        repos, and any analysis is aggregated up from all of those into a single output (pandas dataframe).
        
        
        This is a pre-v1.0.0 project, so the interfaces and functionality may change.
        
        Current functionality includes:
        
         * Commit history with extension and directory filtering
         * Edited files history with extension and directory filtering
         * Blame with extension and directory filtering
         * Branches 
         * Tags
         * ProjectDirectory-level general information table
         * Approximate bus factor
         * Cumulative Blame as a time series
          
        Please see examples for more detailed usage. The image above is generated using the repository object's cumulative blame
        function on stravalib.
