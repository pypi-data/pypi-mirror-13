topydo is a todo list application using the todo.txt format. It is heavily inspired by the todo.txt CLI by Gina Trapani. This tool is actually a merge between the todo.txt CLI and a number of extensions that I wrote on top of the CLI. These extensions are:

* Set due and start dates;
* Custom sorting;
* Dealing with tags;
* Maintain dependencies between todo items;
* Allow todos to recur;
* Some conveniences when adding new items (e.g. adding creation date and use relative dates)
