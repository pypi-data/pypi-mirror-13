Description: ===========
        ZK Cluster
        ===========
        
        This library provides a framework for writing clustered services.
        
        Currently, it is derived from the basis used in HAAlchemy, and is
        intended to be used with `HAAlchemy <https://bitbucket.org/zzzeek/haalchemy>`_
        and `Connmon <https://bitbucket.org/zzzeek/connmon>`_.
        
        The core of the framework is a clusterable service which can connect
        with other clusterable services using a p2p system, and within the p2p
        system a partial implementation of the RAFT consensus algorithm may
        also be used for "leader" selection.
        
        Messaging is performed using a simple RPC scheme.
        Applications which use the system only work with RPC message objects.
        
        The file ``demo.py`` illustrates some use of the API.
        
        The ZKCluster API is very specific to its current use cases, and is likely
        not useful as a general use RPC / clustering library.
