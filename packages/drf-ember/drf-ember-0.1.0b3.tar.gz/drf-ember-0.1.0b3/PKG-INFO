Description: =========
        drf-ember
        =========
        
        Enables Django REST Framework support for Ember Data's JSON API implementation.
        
        JSON API feature support
        ------------------------
        
        Presently, **drf-ember** supports a majority - but not all - of
        the JSON API specifications features and extensions.
        
        Supported
        .........
        
        These features are supported.
        
        - Generation of JSON API document structure
        
        - The core functionality for retrieval, creation, updating, and deletion of resources
        
        - The ``included`` top-level member is supported by parsing nested serializer fields.
          See the *Getting Started* guide in the documentation.
        
        - Error objects
        
        - The bulk extension for creation and updating of resource lists
        
        Not supported
        .............
        
        These features are not supported.
        
        - ``links`` objects are not generated
        
        - Fetching relationship data for every relationship URL provided as a ``self``
          link as part of a relationship's ``links`` object.
        
        - Endpoints can't presently support an ``include`` request parameter which
          allows the client to customize which related resources should be returned.
          Presently, **drf-ember** will return a blank ``400`` if the ``include``
          request parameter is present.
        
        - Sparse fieldsets
        
        - Sort fields through query parameters
        
        - Updating relationships at URLs from relationship links
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        Python 3. Python 2 is **not** supported and there is **no** plan to support it.
        
        Install
        -------
        
        Use ``pip``::
        
            pip install drf-ember
