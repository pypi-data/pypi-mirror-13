        - usage: 
          - `from prettysettings import Settings`
          - `settings = Settings(defaults = {'option1': 1, 'option2': 'myoption'}, filename='./settings.json')`
          - `print(settings.option1)`
        
        - if any of the settings is found in env variables than it is overridden
        
        - override order is:
          - first read from defaults
          - then override from file
          - last override from env variables
        
        - type:
          - defaults dict is used as reference for type parsing when loading from env variables
        
        - keys:
          - defaults dict is used as reference to load keys from file and from env variables
          - a key found in the file (or env vars) which is not present in the defaults is discarded
