CursedXDG is a simple curses xdg desktop menu

It takes a XDG standard directory with .desktop files ( by default /usr/share/applications ) 
and creates a complete ncurses menu with it.

This way you can have your normal system menu with an ncurses TUI, or even make your own menu with .desktop 
files for your terminal distribution
