Welcome to Pyslet
=================

..  note::
    You are reading documentation for the pyslet-0.6.20160201 release of
    Pyslet to PyPi. The latest version, corresponding to the GitHub
    master is available here__
    
    ..  __: http://pyslet.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

Pyslet_ is a Python package for Standards in Learning Education and
Training (LET). It implements a number of LET-specific standards,
including IMS QTI, Content Packaging and Basic LTI.  It also includes
support for some general standards, including the data access standard
OData (see http://www.odata.org).

..  _Pyslet: http://www.pyslet.org

Pyslet was originally written to be the engine behind the QTI migration
tool but it can be used independently as a support module for your own
Python applications.

Full documentation is hosted at http://pyslet.readthedocs.org

Pyslet currently supports Python 2.6 and 2.7, see docs for details.

  

Distribution
------------

Pyslet is developed on GitHub: https://github.com/swl10/pyslet but it
can be downloaded and installed from the popular PyPi package
distribution site: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyslet using *pip*.

While Pyslet is being actively developed the version on PyPi may lag
a few months behind the master branch on GitHub.  The unittests are
fairly comprehensive and are automatically run against the master
branch using TravisCI_:

   :target: https://travis-ci.org/swl10/pyslet

Users of older Python builds (e.g., the current Python 2.6 installed on
OS X as of August 2014) should be aware that pip may well fail to
install itself or other modules due to a failure to connect to the PyPi
repository.  Fixing this is hard and installing from source is
recommended instead if you are afflicted by this issue.


Installing from Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Pyslet package contains a setup.py script so you can install it
by downloading the compressed archive, uncompressing it and then
running the following command inside the package::

    python setup.py install


Current Status & Road Map
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pyslet is going through a transition process at the moment as the QTI
migration tool that drives its development is gradually moving towards
being distributed as an LTI tool rather than a desktop application.

The OData support is fairly robust, it is used to run the Cambridge Weather
OData service which can be found at http://odata.pyslet.org/weather

What's next?

*   MySQL shim for the OData SQL storage model (90% complete and
    functional)

*   Improved support for LTI to take it beyond 'basic' (60% complete)

*   Python 3 support (10% complete)

I'm also slowly transforming the code for better PEP-8 compliance as
reported by the fantastic flake8_.  For important information about how
this affects existing Pyslet users see the What's New? section of the
documentation or the CHANGES.rst file in the distribution package.

Google Code project:

Some of the code was written almost 20 years ago and it owes a lot to
the University of Cambridge and, in particular, to the team I worked
with at UCLES (aka Cambridge Assessment) who were instrumental in
getting this project started.
