        This plugin adds support for [Google analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) to [Lektor CMS](https://github.com/lektor/lektor).
        
        Once the plugin is enabled, a `generate_google_analytics()` function
        is available to be included in target `template` which automatically include Google-Analytics code in final HTML files rendered by `Lektor`.
        
        ## Basic Usage
        
        ### Enabling the Plugin
        
        To enable the plugin add this to your project file:
        
        ```ini
        [packages]
        lektor-google-analytics = 0.1
        ```
        
        ### Configuring the Plugin
        
        The plugin needs a config file with your `Google analytics` code in it.
        
        Just create a file named `google-analytics.ini` into `./configs` folder in your Lektor project's base directory. And, put the `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID` key with target
        property ID of form `UA-XXXXXXXX-Y` which you obtained from:
        
        ```ini
        GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID = UA-XXXXXXXX-Y
        ```
        
        ### Using in Templates
        
        Now you can add a Google analytics code-snippet in your templates by
        just calling the `generate_google_analytics` function in its <body> </body> tag as below.
        
        ```html
        <div class="ga-script">{{ generate_google_analytics() }}</div>
        ```
        
        That's it. All the `HTML` files that rendered from that template will include Google-Analytics code automatically.
        
        ------
        ### Advanced
        
        * You can use `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_PROPERTY` property to include your custom-built
        Google Analytics tracking code. In that case, your `./configs/google-analytics.ini` will look like this:
        
        ```ini
        GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID = UA-XXXXXXXX-Y
        GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_PROPERTY = 'my custom code'
        ```
        
        Don't use this property unless you know what are you doing.
        By default, it is set to `auto`.
        
        To go deeper than this, please refer to
        [Google-Analytics documentation](http://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/).
