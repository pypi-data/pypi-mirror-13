* some minor fixes (DaoSupport.query attribute, export of DaoException, ...)

* compatibility issues with SQLAlchemy 0.5, this is now the required version

* testing with real-world projects => first Beta release!

* known problems -- AOP -- calling proxied method (ie. decorated) from a
  non-proxy 'self' object (ie. calling private proxy method from non-proxied
  public method of the same object) does not invoke an advice

  workaround -- mark all your public methods with an annotation, do not rely on
  annotating private methods

  fix -- though possible, ugly; i will try to think up something better

* added assert module for various tests/checks -- ass.py

* utility method for exception stacktrace pretty printing -- even from aop
  code
