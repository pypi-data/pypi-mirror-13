# aptdetector

*Advanced Persistent Threat Detection by Using Network Analysis*

**aptdetector** is a humble try to gather all means of malware detection
from network analysis in one place, for educational purposes only.

* used [pcap-parser][pcap-parser] as the base for network analysis module
* use [Cuckoo Sandbox][Cuckoo] as automated malware detection

aptdetector is tested against Python 3.4, 3.5, and PyPy.
[Full and extensive docs would be available at Read The Docs.][rtd]
See what's new by checking the [CHANGELOG][changelog].

[rtd]: https://aptdetector.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
[changelog]: https://github.com/abzcoding/aptdetector/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md
[pcap-parser]: https://github.com/caoqianli/pcap-parser
[Cuckoo]: https://downloads.cuckoosandbox.org/docs/

## Installation

aptdetector can be added to a project in a few ways. There's the obvious one:

``` sh
    pip install aptdetector
```

Then, [thanks to PyPI][aptdetector_pypi], aptdetector is just an import away:

``` python
    from aptdetector.network.sniffer import URLSniffer
    sniffer = URLSniffer
    sniffer.pcap_file = 'sample.pcap'
    sniffer.connections(source='10.66.133.90',simplify=True,show_port=True)
```

However, due to the nature of utilities, application developers might
dependencies. See the [Integration][integration] section of the docs

[integration]: https://aptdetector.readthedocs.org/en/latest/architecture.html#integration

## Disclaimer

Please do not use this program in production!!
it's an educational project only.
