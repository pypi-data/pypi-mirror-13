# Buildd Slave tool to unpack a chroot tarball

# Expects build id as arg 1, makes build-id to contain the build
# Expects bzip2 compressed tarball as arg 2

# Needs TAR to be set to a gnu tar instance, that needs bzip2
# Needs SUDO to be set to a sudo instance for passwordless access
# BUNZIP2 must un-bzip2
# FILE must implement the -b and -i arguments (so a Debianish file)
