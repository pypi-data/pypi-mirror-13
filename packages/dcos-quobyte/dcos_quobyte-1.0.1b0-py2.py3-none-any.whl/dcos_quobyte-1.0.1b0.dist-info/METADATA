# DCOS Quobyte Subcommand

Basic DCOS subcommand

## Setup

1. Make sure you meet requirements for installing [packages](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/installing.html#installing-requirements)
2. Clone git repo for the dcos quobyte cli::

    git clone git@github.com:quobyte/dcos-quobyte.git

3. Change directory to the repo directory::

    cd dcos-quoybyte

4. Make sure that you have virtualenv installed. If not type::

    sudo pip install virtualenv

5. Create a virtualenv for the project::

    make env

## Configure Environment and Run

1. TODO: Talk about how to configure the root dcos cli

2. ```source``` the setup file to add the ```dcos-quobyte``` command line interface to your
   ```PATH``` :

```
source env/bin/activate
```

3. Get started by calling the DCOS Quobyte CLI's help::

```
dcos quobyte help
```

## Running Tests:

### Setup

Tox, our test runner, tests against both Python 2.7 and Python 3.4 environments.

If you're using OS X, be sure to use the officially distributed Python 3.4 installer_ since the
Homebrew version is missing a necessary library.

### Running

Tox will run unit and integration tests in both Python environments using a temporarily created
virtualenv.

You should ensure ```DCOS_CONFIG``` is set and that the config file points to the Marathon
instance you want to use for integration tests.

There are two ways to run tests, you can either use the virtualenv created by ```make env```
above:

    make test

Or, assuming you have tox installed (via :code:`sudo pip install tox`):

    tox

### Other Useful Commands

1. List all of the supported test environments:

```
tox --listenvs
```

2. Run a specific set of tests:

```
tox -e <testenv>
```
