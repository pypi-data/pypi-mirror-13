Description: Swiss Time - A diagnostic code timer
        =======================================
        Swiss Time is a diagnostic tool for finding slow spots in code. It sits somewhere between a raw timer and a profiler.
        
        <https://github.com/built/swisstime>
        
        Once started, each call to tick() will record a time difference along a label that you provide.
        
        In this way you build a timeline over the portion of code you are analyzing.
        
        You can print a report of the results or gather report data to process your own way.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Import and start the timer at the beginning of the code you want to analyze.
        
         >>> import swisstime
         >>> swisstime.start()
        
        At the end of each section you want measured, call tick() with a description of that piece of code:
        
         >>> swisstime.tick("Load input image")
        
        Do this after each section you are measuring:
        
         >>> action.tick("Build masks")
        
        To display a report of your results, print the output of swisstime.report():
        
         >>> print( swisstime.report() )
        
        Your output will be a table of times and labels for each section you measured.
        
        If you want the raw report data you can call:
        
        >>> swisstime.data()
        
        to get a list of label/time tuples.
        
        Calling start() will reset all data and begin the analysis again.
