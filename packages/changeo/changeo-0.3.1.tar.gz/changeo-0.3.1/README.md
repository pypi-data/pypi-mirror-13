Version 0.3.1:  December 18, 2015
==============================================================================

Change-O is a collection of tools for analyzing immunoglobulin sequences. 
Dramatic improvements in high-throughput sequencing technologies now enable 
large-scale characterization of immunoglobulin (Ig) repertoires, defined as the 
collection of trans-membrane antigen-receptor proteins located on the surface 
of T and B lymphocytes. Change-O is a suite of utilities to handle advanced 
analysis of Ig sequences following germline segment assignment. Change-O 
handles output from IMGT/HighV-QUEST and IgBLAST. It includes features for 
creating a personalized genotype, identifying sequences that are from a single 
B cell clone and inferring its lineage tree, analyzing amino acid properties, 
calculating diversity, generating a model of somatic hypermutation, and 
quantifying selection pressure. Record sorting, grouping, and sampling 
operations are also included.


Requirements
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* [Python 3.4.0](http://python.org)
* [setuptools 2.0](http://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools)
* [NumPy 1.8](http://numpy.org)
* [SciPy 0.14](http://scipy.org)
* [pandas 0.15](http://pandas.pydata.org)
* [Biopython 1.65](http://biopython.org)
* [presto 0.5](http://clip.med.yale.edu/presto)
* [MUSCLE v3.8](http://www.drive5.com/muscle)

Installation - Linux
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. The simplest way to install all Python dependencies is to install the full 
   SciPy stack using the [instructions](http://scipy.org/install.html), then 
   install Biopython according to its 
   [instructions](http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/install/Installation.html).
   
2. Install pRESTO 0.5.0 or greater from [here](http://clip.med.yale.edu/presto).

3. Extract the Change-O bundle and run:  
   `> python3 setup.py install --user`

Installation - Windows
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Install Python 3.4.0+ from [Python](http://python.org/downloads), selecting
   both the options 'pip' and 'Add python.exe to Path'.

2. Install NumPy, SciPy, pandas and Biopython using the packages available from 
   the [Unofficial Windows binary](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs)
   collection.

3. Unzip the Change-O bundle, open a Command Prompt, change directories to the
   Change-O folder, and run:  
   `> python setup.py install`.
   
4. For a default installation of Python 3.4, the Change-O scripts will be 
   installed into `C:\Python34\Scripts` and should be directly executable from 
   the Command Prompt. If this is not the case, then follow step 5 below.
   
5. Add both the `C:\Python34` and `C:\Python34\Scripts` directories to your 
   `%Path%`. On Windows 7 the `%Path%` setting is located under Control Panel 
    -> System and Security -> System -> Advanced System Settings -> 
    Environment variables -> System variables -> Path.


Installation - Mac OS X
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Install Xcode 3.2.6
   Available from the Apple store or
   [developer downloads](http://developer.apple.com/downloads).
   If you have a newer version (eg, Xcode 4.6.3) that will work also,
   but Xcode 3 is free of charge.  If Xcode fails to install with an
   "Unknown Error", change the date on your system to some time in 2011,
   install Xcode, and then change the date back to the proper setting.

2. Install XQuartz 2.7.5
   Available from the [XQuartz project](http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing).

3. Install Homebrew
   Follow the installation and post-installation [instructions](http://brew.sh).

4. Open a terminal and install gfortran (required for SciPy) using Homebrew
   (this can take an hour to install):  
   `> brew install gfortran`  
   If the above fails run this instead:  
   `> brew install --env=std gfortran`  

5. Install Python 3.4.0+ and set the path to the python3 executable:  
   `> brew install python3`  
   `> echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.profile`  
   Exit and reopen the terminal application so the PATH setting takes effect

6. Install NumPy, SciPy, pandas and Biopyton using the Python package manager:  
   `> pip3 install numpy scipy pandas biopython`

7. Extract the Change-O bundle, open a terminal window, change directories to 
   the Change-O folder, and run:  
   `> python3 setup.py install`
