        Server for [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org), the Free Software repository system
        for Android.
        
        The F-Droid server tools provide various scripts and tools that are used to
        maintain the main [F-Droid application repository](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse).
        You can use these same tools to create your own additional or alternative
        repository for publishing, or to assist in creating, testing and submitting
        metadata to the main repository.
        
        For documentation, please see the docs directory.

        ### What is F-Droid?
        
        F-Droid is an installable catalogue of FOSS (Free and Open Source Software)
        applications for the Android platform. The client makes it easy to browse,
        install, and keep track of updates on your device.
        
        ### Installing
        
        Note that only Python 2 is supported. We recommend version 2.7.7 or
        later.
        
        The easiest way to install the `fdroidserver` tools is on Ubuntu, Mint or other
        Ubuntu based distributions, you can install using:
        
        	sudo apt-get install fdroidserver
        
        For older Ubuntu releases or to get the latest version, you can get
        `fdroidserver` from the Guardian Project PPA (the signing key
        fingerprint is `6B80 A842 07B3 0AC9 DEE2 35FE F50E ADDD 2234 F563`)
        
        	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:guardianproject/ppa
        	sudo apt-get update
        	sudo apt-get install fdroidserver
        
        On OSX, `fdroidserver` is available from third party package managers,
        like Homebrew, MacPorts, and Fink:
        
        	brew install fdroidserver
        
        For Arch-Linux is a package in the AUR available. If you have installed
        `yaourt` or something similiar, you can do:
        
        	yaourt -S fdroidserver
        
        For any platform where Python's `easy_install` is an option (e.g. OSX
        or Cygwin, you can use it:
        
        	sudo easy_install fdroidserver
        
        Python's `pip` also works:
        
        	sudo pip install fdroidserver
        
        The combination of `virtualenv` and `pip` is great for testing out the
        latest versions of `fdroidserver`. Using `pip`, `fdroidserver` can
        even be installed straight from git. First, make sure you have
        installed the python header files, virtualenv and pip. They should be
        included in your OS's default package manager or you can install them
        via other mechanisms like Brew/dnf/pacman/emerge/Fink/MacPorts.
        
        For Debian based distributions:
        
        	apt-get install python-dev python-pip python-virtualenv
        
        Then here's how to install:
        
        	git clone https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidserver.git
        	cd fdroidserver
        	virtualenv env/
        	source env/bin/activate
        	pip install -e .
        	python2 setup.py install
