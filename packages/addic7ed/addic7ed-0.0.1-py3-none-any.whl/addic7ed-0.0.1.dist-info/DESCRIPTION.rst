Addic7ed Scraper
================

**First of all, be aware that this is a VERY FIRST draft of a scraper
for Addic7ed.com's subtitles**

Requirements
------------

This scraper is made to work with Python 3 only. It is pre-installed on
many linux distribution.

If it's not your case, install it :p

Install
-------

::

    git clone https://github.com/Jesus-21/addic7ed.git addic7ed

or download/unzip
`archive <https://github.com/Jesus-21/addic7ed/archive/master.zip>`__

then (from download/clone path):

::

    sudo pip install -r requirements.txt

or use python `Python
virtualenv <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/>`__
and install requirements within.

Finally, edit *constants.py* file to uncomment the language you need.

Usage
-----

*addic7ed.py* file should be excutable, just run it from the folder
where your video files are.

::

    $ /git/clone/path/addic7ed.py

then it will prompt which file you want to download. If download is
successful, it will rename the video file to match subtitle file. e.g.:
|Example|

TODO List
---------

-  Packaging (for pip/easy\_install)
-  Error management (almost none right now)
-  Langue choice through config file
-  Intelligent auto-download (using release name + completion +
   popularity)
-  Better file crawling (recursivity mainly)
-  More pre/post processing of series names
-  (Python 2 support?)

Suggestions and/or pull requests are more than welcome!
