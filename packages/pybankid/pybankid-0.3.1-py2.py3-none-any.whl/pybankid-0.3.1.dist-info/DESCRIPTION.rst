PyBankID is a client for performing BankID signing.

The Swedish BankID solution for digital signing uses a SOAP
connection solution, and this module aims at providing a simplifying
client for making authentication, signing and collect requests to
the BankID servers.

The latest development version is available at the project's `GitHub
