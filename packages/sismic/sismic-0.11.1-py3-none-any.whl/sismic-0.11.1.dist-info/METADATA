Sismic Interactive State Machine Interpreter and Checker
--------------------------------------------------------

Statecharts are a well-known visual language for modeling the executable behavior of complex reactive event-based systems.
The Sismic library for Python >= 3.4 provides a set of tools to define, simulate, execute and debug statecharts.
More specifically, Sismic provides:

 - An easy way to define and to import statecharts, based on the human-friendly YAML markup language
 - A statechart interpreter offering discrete, step-by-step, and fully observable simulation engine
 - Built-in support for expressing actions and guards using regular Python code
 - A design-by-contract programming approach for statecharts
 - A unit testing framework for statecharts

Installation
------------

Sismic can be installed using ``pip`` as usual: ``pip install sismic``.
This will install the latest stable version.

You can also install Sismic from this repository by cloning it.
The development occurs in the *master* branch, the latest stable distributed version is in the *stable* branch.

Sismic requires Python >=3.4 but should also work with Python 3.3.

Documentation
-------------

The latest version of the documentation is available at http://sismic.readthedocs.org/
.

It can also be directly built from the ``docs/`` directory using Sphinx.
