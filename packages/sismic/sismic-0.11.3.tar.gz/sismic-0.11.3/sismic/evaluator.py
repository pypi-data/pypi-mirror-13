    Evaluator that interprets Python code.

    Depending on the method that is called, the context can expose additional values:

     - Always:
        - A ``time`` value that represents the current time exposed by the interpreter.
     - On code execution:
        - A ``send`` function that takes an ``Event`` (also exposed) and fires an internal event with.
        - If the code is related to a transition, the ``event`` that fires the transition is exposed.
     - On code evaluation:
        - An ``active(name) -> bool`` Boolean function that takes a state name and return ``True`` if and only
          if this state is currently active, ie. it is in the active configuration of the ``Interpreter`` instance
          that makes use of this evaluator.
        - If the code is related to a transition, the ``event`` that fires the transition is exposed.
     - On guard evaluation:
        - An ``after(sec) -> bool`` Boolean function that returns ``True`` if and only if the source state
          was entered more than *sec* seconds ago. The time is evaluated according to Interpreter's clock.
        - A ``idle(sec) -> bool`` Boolean function that returns ``True`` if and only if the source state
          did not fire a transition for more than *sec* ago. The time is evaluated according to Interpreter's clock.
     - On postcondition or invariant:
        - A variable ``__old__`` that has an attribute ``x`` for every ``x`` in the context when either the state
          was entered (if the condition involves a state) or the transition was processed (if the condition
          involves a transition). The value of ``__old__.x`` is a shallow copy of ``x`` at that time.

    Unless you override its entry in the context, the ``__builtins__`` of Python are automatically exposed.
    This implies you can use nearly everything from Python in your code.

    If an exception occurred while executing or evaluating a piece of code, it is propagated by the
    evaluator.
