def teststory_from_trace(trace: list) -> Story:
    """
    Return a test story based on the given *trace*, a list of macro steps.

    The story is constructed as follows:

     - the story begins with a *started* event.
     - the delay between pairs of consecutive steps creates a ``Pause`` instance.
     - each time an event is consumed, a *consumed* event is created.
       the consumed event is available through the ``event`` attribute.
     - each time a state is exited, an *exited* event is created.
       the name of the state is available through the ``state`` attribute.
     - each time a transition is processed, a *processed* event is created.
       the source state name and the target state name (if any) are available respectively through
       the ``source`` and ``target`` attributes.
       The event processed by the transition is available through the ``event`` attribute.
     - each time a state is entered, an *entered* event is created.
       the name of the state is available through the ``state`` attribute.
     - the story ends with a *stopped* event.

    The story does follow the interpretation order:

    1. an event is possibly consumed
    2. For each transition

       a. states are exited
       b. transition is processed
       c. states are entered
       d. statechart is stabilized (states are entered)
