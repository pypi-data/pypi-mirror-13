Statecharts definition
======================

About statecharts
-----------------

Statecharts are a well-known visual language for modeling the executable behavior of complex reactive event-based systems.
They were invented in the 1980s by David Harel, and have gained a more widespread adoption since they became part of
the UML modeling standard.

Statecharts offer more sophisticated modeling concepts than the more classical state diagrams of finite state machines.
For example, they support hierarchical composition of states, orthogonal regions
to express parallel execution, guarded transitions, and actions on transitions or states. Different flavours of
executable semantics for statecharts have been proposed in the literature and in existing tools.

Defining statecharts in YAML
----------------------------

Because Sismic is supposed to be independent of a particular visual modeling tool, and easy to integrate in other programs
without requiring the implementation of a visual notation, statecharts are expressed using YAML, a human-friendly textual
notation (the alternative of using something like SCXML was discarded because its notation is too verbose and not
really "human-readable".)

This section explains how the elements that compose a valid statechart in Sismic can be defined using YAML.
If you are not familiar with YAML, have a look at `YAML official documentation <http://yaml.org/spec/1.1/>`__.

Statechart
**********

The root of the YAML file **must** declare a statechart:

.. code:: yaml

    statechart:
      name: Name of the statechart
      initial: name of the initial state
      description: Description of the statechart

The ``name`` and the ``initial`` state are mandatory, the ``description`` is optional.
If specific code needs to be executed during initialization of the statechart, this can be specified
using ``on entry``. In this example, the code is written in Python.

.. code:: yaml

    statechart:
      name: statechart containing initialization code
      initial: s1
      on entry: x = 1


Code can be written on multiple lines as follows:

.. code:: yaml

    on entry: |
      x = 1
      y = 2


States
******

A statechart must declare a (nonempty) list of states using ``states``.
Each state consist of at least a mandatory ``name``. Depending on the state type, other optional fields can be declared.

.. code:: yaml

    statemachine:
      name: with state
      initial: s1
      states:
        - name: s1


Entry and exit actions
**********************

For each declared state, the optional ``on entry`` and ``on exit`` fields can be used to specify the code that has to be executed when entering and leaving the state:

.. code:: yaml

    - name: s1
      on entry: x += 1
      on exit: |
        x -= 1
        y = 2

Final states
************

A *final state* can be declared by specifying the ``type: final`` property:

.. code:: yaml

    - name: s1
      type: final

Shallow and deep history states
*******************************

*History states* can be declared as follows:

The ``type: shallow history`` property declares a *shallow history* state;
the ``type: deep history`` property declares a *deep history* state.
We refer to the semantics of UML and SCXML for the difference between both types of histories.

.. code:: yaml

    - name: history state
      type: shallow history

A history state can optionally declare a default initial memory using ``initial``.
Importantly, the ``initial`` memory value **must** refer to a parent's substate.

.. code:: yaml

  - name: history state
    type: deep history
    initial: s1


Composite states
****************

A state that is neither a final state nor a history state can contain nested states.
Such a state is commonly called a *composite state*.

.. code:: yaml

  - name: compound state
    states:
      - name: nested state 1
      - name: nested state 2
        states:
          - name: nested state 2a

Regions
*******

A region is essentially a logical set of nested states. Unlike UML, but similarly to SCXML, Sismic does
not explicitly represent the concept of *region*, as it is implicitly defined by its composite state.


Orthogonal states
*****************

*Orthogonal states* (sometimes referred as *parallel states*) allow to specify multiple nested statecharts running in parallel.
They must declare their nested states using ``parallel states`` instead of ``states``.

.. code:: yaml

  statechart:
    name: statechart containing multiple orthogonal states
    initial: processes
    states:
      - name: processes
        parallel states:
          - name: process 1
          - name: process 2

Orthogonal states cannot be declared at top level, they should always be nested in a composite state, as
illustrated in the previous example. For example, it is not allowed to define ``parallel states``
instead of ``states`` in this example.

Transitions
***********

*Transitions* between states, compound states and parallel states can be declared with the ``transitions`` field.
Transitions typically specify a target state using the ``target`` field:

.. code:: yaml

  - name: state with transitions
    transitions:
      - target: other state

Other optional fields can be specified for a transition:
a ``guard`` (a Boolean expression that will be evaluated to determine if the transition can be followed),
an ``event`` (name of the event that will trigger the transition),
an ``action`` (code that will be executed if the transition is processed).
Here is a full example of a transition specification:

.. code:: yaml

  - name: state with an outgoing transition
    transitions:
      - target: some other state
        event: click
        guard: x > 1
        action: print('Hello World!')

One type of transition, called an *internal transition*, does not require to declare a ``target``.
Instead, it **must** either define an event or define a guard to determine when it should become active
(Otherwise, infinite loops would occur during simulation or execution).

Statechart examples
-------------------

Elevator
********

The Elevator statechart is one of the running examples in this documentation. Its visual description (currently not supported by Sismic) could look as follows:

.. image:: /images/elevator.png

The corresponding YAML description is given below. To make the statechart self-contained, a Python class ``Doors``
is included containing two methods ``open()`` and ``close()`` and a boolean variable ``opened``. Upon entering in the *active* state, a ``doors`` object of this class will be created and initialised by setting the value of ``opened`` to ``True``.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/elevator.yaml
   :language: yaml

Microwave
*********

The Microwave statechart contains 4 parallel states *door*, *heating*, *turntable* and *lamp*.

Notice the use of the ``description`` field in the YAML specification given below. This field will be ignored when imported into Sismic, but can be used to provide additional information about the statechart to the user.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/microwave.yaml
    :language: yaml


Importing and validating statecharts
------------------------------------

A YAML definition of a statechart can be easily imported to a :py:class:`~sismic.model.StateChart` instance.
The module :py:mod:`sismic.io` provides a convenient loader :py:func:`~sismic.io.import_from_yaml`
which takes a textual YAML definition of a statechart. It also provides a way to export statecharts to YAML.

.. automodule:: sismic.io
    :members: import_from_yaml, export_to_yaml
    :noindex:

For example:

.. testcode:: python

    from sismic import io, model

    with open('examples/elevator.yaml') as f:
        statechart = io.import_from_yaml(f)
        assert isinstance(statechart, model.StateChart)


The parser performs an automatic validation against the YAML schema of the next subsection, and also
validates the resulting statechart using :py:meth:`sismic.model.StateChart.validate`.
