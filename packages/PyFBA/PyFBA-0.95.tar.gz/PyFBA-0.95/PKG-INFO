Description: PyFBA
        =====
        
        A python implementation of flux balance analysis to model microbial
        metabolism
        
        About PyFBA
        -----------
        
        PyFBA is a Python flux-balance-analysis package that allows you to build
        models from genomes, gapfill models, and run flux-balance-analysis on
        that model. The aim of PyFBA is to provide an extensible, python-based
        platform for FBA work.
        
        PyFBA is being developed by Daniel Cuevas, Taylor O'Connell, and Rob
        Edwards in Rob's bioinformatics group at San Diego State University
        together with help from Janaka Edirisinghe, Chris Henry, Ross Overbeek
        and others at Argonne National Labs.
        
        Installing PyFBA
        ----------------
        
        To use PyFBA you need Python 2.7 or greater, and you need to install the
        GNU GLPK and a Python wrapper for that program, pyGLPK available from
        github.
        
        We also leverage the Model SEED GitHub repository with all the latest
        biochemistry tables.
        
        Our installation page has detailed instructions on installing PyFBA and
        getting everything running.
        
        Getting Started with PyFBA
        --------------------------
        
        Once you have installed GLPK, PyGLPK, and PyFBA, you will most likely
        want to build a model from a genome, gap fill that model, and test it
        for growth on different media. We have detailed instructions that walk
        you through the step-by-step procedures that you need to use to run flux
        balance analysis on your own genome.

        Version 0.95
        ============
        
        Several changes to files:
        
        Updated the subsystem functions and changed the name to a generic name. The date is handled by versioning!
        
        -   PyFBA/Biochemistry/SEED/Subsystems/SS_functions.txt  
        -   PyFBA/Biochemistry/SEED/Subsystems/SS_functions_Oct_2015.txt
        
        Changing the version number
        
        -   PyFBA/init.py
        
        Adding reaction flux information that can be pulled after the sm has been solved
        
        -   PyFBA/fba/init.py  
        -   PyFBA/fba/fluxes.py
        
        External reactions
        
        Fixed an issue where we were over-incorporating reactions based on
        things in the media
        
        -   PyFBA/fba/bounds.py  
        -   PyFBA/parse/model_seed.py
        
        Adding verboseness
        
        -   PyFBA/fba/run_fba.py  
        -   PyFBA/gapfill/roles.py  
        -   PyFBA/parse/read_media.py
        
        Reduced complexity
        
        We only test the right half of the reactions if the left half do not
        grow, and once we have <10 reactions  
        to search through we just iterate and knock out each reaction
        sequentially. It is faster than the shuffle  
        approach.
        
        -   PyFBA/gapfill/minimize_additional_reactions.py
        
        Changed the way we read roles
        
        SEED has a notion of multifunctional roles, and we added splitting those
        functions into roles
        
        -   PyFBA/gapfill/subsystem.py
        
        Gap generation code
        
        Testing each of the individual reactions in a model
        
        -   PyFBA/gapgeneration/test_reactions.py  
        -   example_code/test_individual_reactions.py
        
        Shifted the order of gapfilling
        
        This order makes more logical sense!
        
        -   example_code/gapfill_from_reactions.py
        
        Updated the tests
        
        With all these changes, the tests were not right
        
        -   PyFBA/tests/reaction_list.txt  
        -   PyFBA/tests/test_fba.py  
        -   PyFBA/tests/test_suggestions.py
        
        Version 0.9
        ===========
        
        Refactored separating roles to functions. SEED has a concept of
        multifunctional roles and this separates out our roles before we search
        for them.
        
        Version 0.8
        ===========
        
        Version 0.7
        ===========
        
        Version 0.6
        ===========
        
        -   Removed installation dependencies from setup.py because they break
            installation! You need to install the dependencies manually  
        -   Refactored the code to remove the os.environ dependencies
        
        Version 0.5
        ===========
        
        -   Initial release
