Description: PyFBA
        =====
        
        A python implementation of flux balance analysis to model microbial
        metabolism
        
        About PyFBA
        -----------
        
        PyFBA is a Python flux-balance-analysis package that allows you to build
        models from genomes, gapfill models, and run flux-balance-analysis on
        that model. The aim of PyFBA is to provide an extensible, python-based
        platform for FBA work.
        
        PyFBA is being developed by Daniel Cuevas, Taylor O'Connell, and Rob
        Edwards in Rob's bioinformatics group at San Diego State University
        together with help from Janaka Edirisinghe, Chris Henry, Ross Overbeek
        and others at Argonne National Labs.
        
        Installing PyFBA
        ----------------
        
        To use PyFBA you need Python 2.7 or greater, and you need to install the
        GNU GLPK and a Python wrapper for that program, pyGLPK available from
        github.
        
        We also leverage the Model SEED GitHub repository with all the latest
        biochemistry tables.
        
        Our installation page has detailed instructions on installing PyFBA and
        getting everything running.
        
        Getting Started with PyFBA
        --------------------------
        
        Once you have installed GLPK, PyGLPK, and PyFBA, you will most likely
        want to build a model from a genome, gap fill that model, and test it
        for growth on different media. We have detailed instructions that walk
        you through the step-by-step procedures that you need to use to run flux
        balance analysis on your own genome.

        Version 0.9
        ===========
        
        Refactored separating roles to functions. SEED has a concept of
        multifunctional roles and this separates out our roles before we search
        for them.
        
        Version 0.8
        ===========
        
        Version 0.7
        ===========
        
        Version 0.6
        ===========
        
        -   Removed installation dependencies from setup.py because they break
            installation! You need to install the dependencies manually  
        -   Refactored the code to remove the os.environ dependencies
        
        Version 0.5
        ===========
        
        -   Initial release
