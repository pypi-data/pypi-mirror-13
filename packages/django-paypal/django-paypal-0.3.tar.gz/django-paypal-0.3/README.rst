Contributing to django-paypal
=============================

If you want to contribute (yay!), please create a fork and start a branch off
'master' for your changes. Submit a PR on GitHub to request that it is merged.

**isort** keeps imports in order. Run **tox -e isort-check** to check your imports, and **isort <PATHPATH>** to fix them.

All bug fixes and new features will require tests to accompany them, unless it
is very difficult to write the test (e.g. non deterministic behaviour). The
tests should fail without the fix/feature.

Please add to docs/release_notes.rst for any significant bug fixes or new features.

New features need documentation adding in docs/

See docs/tests.rst for info about running the test suite.

If you make changes to the models, please create migrations for both Django 1.7+
and South e.g.::

    ./manage.py makemigrations ipn

    ./manage.py schemamigration --auto ipn

Contributors of any kind are expected to act with politeness to all other
contributors, in pull requests, issue trackers etc., and harassing behaviour
will not be tolerated.
