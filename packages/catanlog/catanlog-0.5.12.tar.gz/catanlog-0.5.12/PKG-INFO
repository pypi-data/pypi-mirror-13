Description: catanlog
        --------
        
        reference implementation for the catanlog (.catan) file format
        
        This project introduces a machine-parsable, human-readable file format for describing a game of Catan.
        
        Until a formal specification is written, this implementation serves as the specification. The spec will likely be formalized once stable, after v1.0.0
        
        Supports Python 3. Might work in Python 2.

        ### Installation
        
        ```
        pip install catanlog
        ```
        
        ### File Format
        
        Each `.catan` file contains all publicly known information in the game.
        Therefore, each `.catan` file contains sufficient information to 'replay' a game (from a spectator's point of view).
        
        The header begins with a version, and ends with `...CATAN!`. The game begins after that.
        
        Tiles are numbered 1 through 19 starting from the most northwest tile and spiralling countercockwise inward.
        See module `hexgrid` (https://github.com/rosshamish/hexgrid) for details.
        
        The format is not yet v1.0, and could change at any time until then.
