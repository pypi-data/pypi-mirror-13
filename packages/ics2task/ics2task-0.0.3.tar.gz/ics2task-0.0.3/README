# ics2task

A CLI tool to import ICS (RFC5455) event into task in TaskWarrior

Considering that an event (Meeting, Todo, Call, etc...) is nothing more than a todo task with a set date, it makes perfect sense to be able to import them into TaskWarrior.
By default the tasks imported are imported in the ics2task project.
Once imported, running `task calendar` will give you your agenda.

## Requires

This module requires two other python modules :

  * icalendar (to parse RFC5455 compliant data)
  * taskw (python bindings for TaksWarrior)

It works both on python2 and python3.

## Install

This module is available on pip :

    #> pip install ics2task


## Example

`ics2task` can either take a file or an input stream

    #> ics2task /path/to/ics/file.ics
    #> task project:ics2task

or

    #> cat /path/to/ics/file.ics | ics2task
    #> task project:ics2task

It becomes really handy in use with mutt where one could add a maccro that would pipe and attached ics file into `ics2task` directly.
