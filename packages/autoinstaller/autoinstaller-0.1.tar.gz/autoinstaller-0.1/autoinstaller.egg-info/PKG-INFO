Description: # autoinstaller
        
        A package that automagically installs from PyPi everything you need as soon as you try import it.
        For example, let's assume that you do not have the tornado web server.
        
            >>> import tornado
            Traceback (most recent call last):
               File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
            ImportError: No module named tornado
        
        But if you have autoinstaller
        
            >>> import autoinstaller
            >>> import tornado
            ...
            Processing dependencies for tornado
            ...
            Installed ...
            Finished processing dependencies for tornado
            >>>
        
        And from now on the package can be used without existing or restarting the process.
