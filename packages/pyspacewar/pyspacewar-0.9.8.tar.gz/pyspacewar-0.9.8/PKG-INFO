Description: Two ships duel in a gravity field.   Gravity doesn't affect
        the ships themselves (which have spanking new anti-gravity
        devices), but it affects missiles launced by the ships.
        
        You can play against the computer, or two players can play
        with one keyboard.  There is also a Gravity Wars mode, where
        the two ships do not move, and the players repeatedly
        specify the direction and velocity of their missiles.

        --------------
        
        February 10, 2016: Released version 0.9.8:
        
        - Switched version control system from Bazaar to Git, hosted on GitHub
          (https://github.com/mgedmin/pyspacewar).  The old svn -> bzr conversion
          was incomplete and lacked the oldest revisions; I've reconverted the
          original svn into git this time and stiched the few newest revisions from
          bzr.
