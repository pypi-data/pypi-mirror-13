Two ships duel in a gravity field.   Gravity doesn't affect
the ships themselves (which have spanking new anti-gravity
devices), but it affects missiles launced by the ships.

You can play against the computer, or two players can play
with one keyboard.  There is also a Gravity Wars mode, where
the two ships do not move, and the players repeatedly
specify the direction and velocity of their missiles.

February 10, 2016: Released version 0.9.8:

- Switched version control system from Bazaar to Git, hosted on GitHub
  (https://github.com/mgedmin/pyspacewar).  The old svn -> bzr conversion
  was incomplete and lacked the oldest revisions; I've reconverted the
  original svn into git this time and stiched the few newest revisions from
  bzr.
