Running the Tests
+++++++++++++++++
First of all, have `tox <http://tox.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ installed on your system. System-wide is probably the better choice. Once you have tox installed, simply run:

.. code:: python

    tox

This will run all tests, against all supported Python versions.


Change Log
----------

1.0.dev8 (2015-02-22)
+++++++++++++++++++++

**Features**

- Added ``altapay.Transaction.create_invoice_reservation()``

1.0.dev7 (2015-02-17)
+++++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- **Backwards incompatible** Changed the name of ``altapay.Transaction.reserve()`` to ``altapay.Transaction.reserve_subscription_charge()``

1.0.dev6 (2015-02-17)
+++++++++++++++++++++

**Features**

- Added ``altapay.Transaction.reserve()`` which will reserve an amount on a subscription

1.0.dev5 (2015-02-11)
+++++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- **Backwards incompatible** Changed the return type of ``altapay.Transaction.charge_subscription()``. It will not return a ``altapay.Callback`` object instead of a list of transactions
- **Backwards incompatible** Changed the argument of ``altapay.Callback.transactions()`` to be keyword only. Will now accept any number of filters, and these will be matched using AND logic

1.0.dev4 (2015-02-03)
+++++++++++++++++++++

**Features**

- Added ``altapay.Transaction.charge_subscription()`` which will charge a subscription on a transaction, if this transaction is setup as a subscription

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed a bug where looking up a non-existent transaction ID would result in a ``KeyError`` (#32)

0.1.dev3 (2015-01-18)
+++++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Added missing apostrophe's in the documentation for the callback guide (#24)
- Fixed a bug where filtering transactions on a ``altapay.Callback`` object might result in a ``KeyError`` (#25)

**Improvements**

- Made it more explicit how attributes on response objects work (#26)

0.1.dev2 (2015-01-14)
+++++++++++++++++++++

**Features**

- Added ``altapay.Transaction`` and the ability to find a transaction by its transaction ID in the AltaPay service
- Added ``altapay.Transaction.capture()`` which captures a transaction that has already been loaded. Optinally, parameters can be passed which allows for partial captures (see the AltaPay documentation for full list of possible arguments)
- Added a public facing API for converting an AltaPay XML response (as a string) to a Python dictionary (``altapay.utils.xml_to_dict``)
- Added ``altapay.Callback`` which wraps a callback response from AltaPay, and automatically wraps the coupled transactions in ``altapay.Transaction`` objects

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed a bug where specifying a non-existing terminal while creating an ``altapay.Payment`` object would result in ``altapay.Payment.success`` returning ``True``
- Fixed a bug where running in production mode was not possible. It is now possible by specifying a shop name when instantiating the API

0.1.dev1 (2015-01-05)
+++++++++++++++++++++

- Complex payments are now possible. This means it is now possible to send detailed payment information in a Pythonic way using just lists and dictionaries, instead of the PHP style query params syntax
- Documentation now includes a small guide for available parts of the SDK, which will make is easier to get started easily without reading the raw API documentation

0.1.dev0 (2015-12-18)
+++++++++++++++++++++

- Basic API connection class implemented in ``altapay.api.API``
- Basic Payment class implemented in ``altapay.payment.Payment`` which is currently mainly for creating a very basic payment request with the AltaPay service
