   SVG
     Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics with support for 
     interactivity and animation.

   PNG
     Portable Network Graphics is a raster graphics file format that supports lossless data compression.

   Python
     Is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code 
     readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in 
     languages such as C++ or Java.

   OpenBadge
     The Mozilla Open Badges (Open Badge Infrastructure or OBI) project is a program by Mozilla that issues digital badges 
     to recognize skills and achievements.

   RSA
      Is one of the first practicable public-key cryptosystems and is widely used for secure data transmission. In such a 
      cryptosystem, the encryption key is public and differs from the decryption key which is kept secret. In RSA, this 
      asymmetry is based on the practical difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers, the factoring 
      problem

   ECC
     Is an approach to public-key cryptography based on the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields. One 
     of the main benefits in comparison with non-ECC cryptography (with plain Galois fields as a basis) is the same level of 
     security provided by keys of smaller size.

   PEP8
     A document that gives coding conventions for the Python code comprising the standard library in the main Python 
     distribution

   Metadata
      Is "data about data". There are two "metadata types;" structural metadata, about the design and specification of 
      data structures or "data about the containers of data"; and descriptive metadata about individual instances of 
      application data or the data content
