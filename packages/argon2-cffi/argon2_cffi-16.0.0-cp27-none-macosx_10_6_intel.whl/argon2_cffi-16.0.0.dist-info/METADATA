`Argon2 <https://github.com/p-h-c/phc-winner-argon2>`_ won the `Password Hashing Competition <https://password-hashing.net/>`_ and ``argon2_cffi`` is the simplest way to use it in Python and PyPy:

.. code-block:: pycon

  >>> from argon2 import PasswordHasher
  >>> ph = PasswordHasher()
  >>> hash = ph.hash("secret")
  >>> hash   # doctest: +SKIP
  '$argon2i$m=512,t=2,p=2$c29tZXNhbHQ$2IdoNVglVTxb9w4YVJqW8w'
  >>> ph.verify(hash, "secret")
  True
  >>> ph.verify(hash, "wrong")
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
  argon2.exceptions.VerificationError: Decoding failed


``argon2_cffi``\ ’s documentation lives at `Read the Docs <https://argon2-cffi.readthedocs.org/>`_, the code on `GitHub <https://github.com/hynek/argon2_cffi>`_.
It’s rigorously tested on Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3+, and PyPy.


Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

I'm using ``bcrypt``/``scrypt``/``PBKDF2``, do I need to migrate?
  Using password hashes that aren't memory hard carries a certain risk but there's **no immediate danger or need for action**.
  If however you are deciding how to hash password *today*, pick Argon2 because it's a superior, future-proof choice.

  But if you already use one of the hashes mentioned in the question, you should be fine for the foreseeable future.


Changelog
=========

Versions are year-based with a strict backward compatibility policy.
The third digit is only for regressions.


16.0.0 (2016-01-02)
-------------------

Vendoring ``argon2`` @ 421dafd2a8af5cbb215e16da5953663eb101d139_.

Deprecations:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- ``hash_password()``, ``hash_password_raw()``, and ``verify_password()`` should not be used anymore.
  For hashing passwords, use the new ``argon2.PasswordHasher``.
  If you want to implement your own higher-level abstractions, use the new low-level APIs ``hash_secret()``, ``hash_secret_raw()``, and ``verify_secret()`` from the ``argon2.low_level`` module.
  If you want to go *really* low-level, ``core()`` is for you.
  The old functions will *not* raise any warnings though and there are *no* immediate plans to remove them.

Changes:
^^^^^^^^

- Add ``argon2.PasswordHasher``.
  A higher-level class specifically for hashing passwords that also works on Unicode strings.
- Add ``argon2.low_level`` module with low-level API bindings for building own high-level abstractions.


15.0.1 (2015-12-18)
-------------------

Vendoring ``argon2`` @ 4fe0d8cda37691228dd5a96a310be57369403a4b_.

Changes:
^^^^^^^^

- Fix ``long_description`` on PyPI.


15.0.0 (2015-12-18)
-------------------

Vendoring ``argon2`` @ 4fe0d8cda37691228dd5a96a310be57369403a4b_.

Changes:
^^^^^^^^

- ``verify_password()`` doesn't guess the hash type if passed ``None`` anymore.
  Supporting this resulted in measurable overhead (~ 0.6ms vs 0.8ms on my notebook) since it had to happen in Python.
  That means that naïve usage of the API would give attackers an edge.
  The new behavior is that it has the same default value as ``hash_password()`` such that ``verify_password(hash_password(b"password"), b"password")`` still works.
- Conditionally use the `SSE2 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE2>`_-optimized version of ``argon2`` on x86 architectures.
- More packaging fixes.
  Most notably compilation on Visual Studio 2010 for Python 3.3 and 3.4.
- Tweaked default parameters to more reasonable values.
  Verification should take between 0.5ms and 1ms on recent-ish hardware.


15.0.0b5 (2015-12-10)
---------------------

Vendoring ``argon2`` @ 4fe0d8cda37691228dd5a96a310be57369403a4b_.

Initial work.
Previous betas were only for fixing Windows packaging.
The authors of ``argon2`` were kind enough to `help me <https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2/issues/44>`_ to get it building under Visual Studio 2008 that we’re forced to use for Python 2.7 on Windows.

The original Argon2 repo can be found at https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2/.

Except for the components listed below, the Argon2 code in this repository is copyright (c) 2015 Daniel Dinu, Dmitry Khovratovich (main authors), Jean-Philippe Aumasson and Samuel Neves, and under CC0_ license.

The string encoding routines in src/encoding.c are copyright (c) 2015 Thomas Pornin, and under CC0_ license.

The `BLAKE2 <https://blake2.net>`_ code in ``src/blake2/`` is copyright (c) Samuel Neves, 2013-2015, and under CC0_ license.

The authors of Argon2 also were very helpful to get the library to compile on ancient versions of Visual Studio for ancient versions of Python.

The documentation also quotes frequently from the Argon2 paper_ to avoid mistakes by rephrasing.

msinttypes
^^^^^^^^^^

In order to be able to compile on Visual Studio 2008 and Visual Studio 2010 which are required for Python 2.6/2.7 and 3.3/3.4 respectively, we also ship two C headers with integer types.
They are from the `msinttypes project <https://code.google.com/p/msinttypes/>`_ (`auto-import on GitHub <https://github.com/chemeris/msinttypes>`_) and licensed under New BSD:
