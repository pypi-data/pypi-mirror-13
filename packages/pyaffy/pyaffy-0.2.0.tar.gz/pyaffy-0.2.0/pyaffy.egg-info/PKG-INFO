        ======

        pyAffy is a Python/Cython implementation of the RMA algorithm for
        processing raw data from Affymetrix expression microarrays.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ git clone ...
            $ cd pyaffy
        	$ pip install -e .
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        The `rma` function expects two parameters: A CDF file and an ordered
        dictionary (of type `collections.OrderedDict`) with sample names as keys
        and corresponding CEL files as values. It returns a list of genes, a
        list of samples, and an expression matrix (of type `numpy.ndarray`), in that
        order.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from pyaffy import rma
            # for documentation of the rma function, try:
            # help(rma)
            genes, samples, X = rma(cdf_file, sample_cel_files)
