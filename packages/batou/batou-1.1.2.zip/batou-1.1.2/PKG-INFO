Description: batou
        =====
        
        batou helps you to automate your application deployments:
        
        * You create a model of your deployment using a simple but powerful Python API.
        * You configure how the model applies to hosts in different environments.
        * You verify and run the deployment with the batou utility.
        
        Getting started with a new project is easy::
        
            $ mkdir myproject
            $ cd myproject
            $ curl https://bitbucket.org/flyingcircus/batou/raw/tip/src/batou/bootstrap-template -o batou
            $ chmod +x batou
            $ ./batou
        
        Here's a minimal application model::
        
            $ mkdir -p components/myapp
            $ cat > components/myapp/component.py
            from batou.component import Component
            from batou.lib.python import VirtualEnv, Package
            from batou.lib.supervisor import Program
        
            class MyApp(Component):
        
                def configure(self):
                    venv = VirtualEnv('2.7')
                    self += venv
                    venv += Package('myapp')
                    self += Program('myapp',
                        command='bin/myapp')
        
        And here's a minimal environment::
        
            $ mkdir environments
            $ cat > environments/dev.cfg
            [environment]
            mode = local
        
            [hosts]
            localhost = myapp
        
        To deploy this, you run::
        
            $ ./batou deploy dev
        
        Check the `detailed documentation <http://batou.readthedocs.org>`_ to get going with a more ambitious project.
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        * Separate your application model from environments
        * Supports idempotent operation for incremental deployments
        * Deploy to multiple hosts simultaneously
        * Automated dependency resolution for multi-host
          scenarios
        * No runtime requirements on your application
        * Encrypted secrets with multiple access levels: store your
          SSL certificates, SSH keys, service secrets and more to get true 1-button deployments.
        * Deploy to local machines, Vagrant, or any SSH host
        * Broad SSH feature support by using OpenSSH through execnet
        * Only few dependencies required on the remote host
        * Ships with a library of components for regularly needed
          tasks
        * self-bootstrapping and self-updating - no additional
          scripting needed

        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.1.2 (2016-01-20)
        ==================
        
        - Improve error reporting for crontab component.
        
        - Fix error ordering.
        
        - Introduce syntax to disable deployment of hosts and components.
          Prefix a hostname with '!' or a component name with '!' to have
          it configured but not deployed. This supports temporary adjustments
          while keeping a consistent config.
        
          We mark this red in the output because this really needs to be used
          carefully.
        
          It replaces the approach in batou 1.0 where one would set up dummy
          hosts and use "batou local dev localhost".
        
        1.1.1 (2016-01-11)
        ==================
        
        - Fix supervisor's buildout dependency to avoid non-convergence of
          the pip-installed package.
        
        1.1 (2016-01-03)
        ================
        
        - Fix Debian supervisor's pid file attribute.
        
        - Update supervisor to 3.2.
        
        
        1.1.0a12 (2015-11-24)
        =====================
        
        - Fix curl initial bootstrap.
        
        - Allow to set the contact group of the Supervisor service check from
          the environment::
        
            [component:supervisor]
            check_contact_groups = group1, group2
        
        
        1.1.0a11 (2015-11-24)
        =====================
        
        - Allow to set the contact group of the Supervisor service check.
        
        
        1.1.0a10 (2015-11-11)
        =====================
        
        - Sort logfiles for logrotate to avoid superfluous reloading.
        
        
        1.1.0a9 (2015-10-14)
        ====================
        
        - Do not implicitly perform attribute conversions when applying overrides.
          Due to the behaviour of `hasattr` this shadowed conversion exceptions
          and also performed unnecessary computation or network access (e.g. DNS).
        
        
        1.1.0a8 (2015-10-05)
        ====================
        
        - Fix default pip arguments for installing packages. This stops rebuilds of
          python/buildout components on each run.
        
        - Change default virtualenv download URL to https and use the current FCIO
          mirror.
        
        
        1.1.0a7 (2015-09-18)
        ====================
        
        - Support Git < 2.0
        
        - Add support for managing Python 3.5 environments.
        
        - Update virtualenv to newest version for Python 2.7+ and all
          Python 3 versions.
        
        - Drop support for Python 3.1.
        
        - Update supervisor: 3.0 -> 3.1.3
        
          Includes updated dependencies.
        
        - Make socketpath in supervisor configurable.
        
        - Fix broken Python compatibility tests.
        
        
        1.1.0a6 (2015-09-17)
        ====================
        
        - Adjust Git repositories to correctly perform fast-forward
          merges.
        
        - Fix Mercurial repository tests that broke without noticing.
        
        - Add end-to-end test for our new error reporting which got a
          regression (#17617)
        
        1.1.0a5 (2015-09-09)
        ====================
        
        - Fix Mercurial repositories after refactorings for Git broke it.
        
        
        1.1.0a4 (2015-09-06)
        ====================
        
        - Actually get pull-based Git repositories to work. Still experimental, though.
        
        
        1.1.0a3 (2015-09-05)
        ====================
        
        - Initial support for managing batou projects with git. Git repositories
          support pull-based and bundle-based shipping.
        
        - Add backwards compatibility for `batou remote` to help users
          migrate their fingers.
        
        1.1.0a2 (2015-09-03)
        ====================
        
        - Fix updating from Batou 1.0
        
        
        1.1.0a1 (2015-09-03)
        ====================
        
        - Do request an update for packages installed from requirements.txt within
          the batou environment to help update VCS checkouts that are pinned.
        
        - Clear PYTHONPATH for bootstrapping to avoid accidental interaction with
          unclean Python environments.
        
        - Provide '--fast' mode: do not perform bootstrapping.
        
          This is a first step to improve bootstrapping times. The switch is rather dumb but allows us to work a) offline
          in some cases and b) develop faster.
        
        - Fix unicode encoding/decoding in File handling. See #14944.
          (Ported from 1.0)
        
        - Fold the runner invocation for `local` and `remote` into
          a single `deploy` command:
        
          $ ./batou deploy <environment>
        
          To force a local or remote invocation use --local and --remote. By default batou will assume a remote environment. To configure an environment's deployment mode use the `mode` attribute in the `environment` section::
        
              [environment]
              mode = local
        
          To specify a manual override on the commandline you can provide the `--local` or `--remote` arguments to the `run` command.
        
        - Improve bootstrapping to give developers a better way
          to get started without installing batou system-wide
          or in a temporary virtualenv.
        
        - Revamp README and documentation.
        
        - Rework error handling and output management.
        
          batou will now show more errors at once, suppress unnecessary internal tracebacks and try to prioritize
          different errors to make complex failure situations
          easier to ingest.
