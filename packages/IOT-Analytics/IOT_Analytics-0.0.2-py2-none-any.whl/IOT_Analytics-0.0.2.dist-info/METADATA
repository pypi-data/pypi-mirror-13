IOT Analytics
=============

**Analytics for your robot or IOT device**

|Package Version| |Build Status| |Coverage Status|

This is a python module designed to provide the tools and resources
needed to gather analytics for real-world objects and events. Analytics
for online sites and services make it possible for developers to improve
workflows and optimize the performance of web pages. The same techniques
can be applied to tangible objects and events.

There are many examples of programmers using services such as `Google
Analytics <https://analytics.google.com>`__ to track everything from
doors opening in a home to trips to the store. Check out this `this
great blog
post <http://nicomiceli.com/tracking-your-home-with-google-analytics/>`__
by Nico Miceli for an example.

Installation
------------

::

    pip install iot_analytics

Project design
==============

This module has two main components

1. Recording data
2. Data analysis

Recording data
==============

**Supported Endpoints**

-  `Google
   Analytics <https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1/devguide>`__
-  IOT Analytics - A custom solution built into this project that you
   can host your self

Data analysis
=============

Analytics is the discovery and communication of meaningful patterns in
data. It is not possible for humans to easily extract meaning from a
collection of billions of database entries. The goal of the data
analysis portion of this project is to provide tools that make it easier
to view and process data in a way that makes data features and trends
more apparent.

Apps
====

This project includes an ``apps`` module which adds support for
integration with the `Zorg <https://github.com/zorg/zorg>`__ robotics
framework.

Roadmap
=======

-  Add data analysis features for hosted storage
-  Integration with `Phant <https://data.sparkfun.com>`__
-  Integration with `Intel IOT
   Analytics <https://dashboard.us.enableiot.com>`__
