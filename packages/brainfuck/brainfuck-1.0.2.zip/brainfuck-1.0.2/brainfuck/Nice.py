Nice.py

Defines traditional Brainfuck interpreters, that is,
Brainfuck interpreters without any shenanigans. This
module is useful for people who are new to Brainfuck
and need time to get used to the original syntax before
undertaking more daunting interpreters like those located
in 'Trolls.py'.
