"""
Trolls.py

Defines Brainfuck interpreters intended to further
frustrate users beyond the original frustration of
nearly unreadable code as a result of Brainfuck's
design and construction.

With the bulk of the infrastructure for further
frustration or "trolling" if you will, performed
with the base class 'TrollInterpreter', all that
derived classes have to do is implement the actual
trolling itself.

This module is designed for people who have add
experience coding in Brainfuck and would like to
get their feet wet with EPIC Brainfuck. Good luck
coding in this environment!
