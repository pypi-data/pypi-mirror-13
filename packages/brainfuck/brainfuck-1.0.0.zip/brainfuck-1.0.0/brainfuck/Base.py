class Interpreter(object):
    """
    Base interpreter upon which all other interpreters are derived.
    This base class does much of the heavy lifting, defining all of
    the Brainfuck interpretation and utility functions (e.g. reading
    a single character from STDIN).

    For classes that derive from ``Interpreter``, what is left to override
    are some of the details surrounding the overall functioning of the
    interpreter itself, such as which eight characters to interpret as
    actual Brainfuck code and the semantics behind each of them.

    Attributes
    ----------
    array : list
        A list of 30,000 integers between 0 and 2**7 - 1 which comprise
        something analogous to a character array in C.

    ptr : int
        A pointer to the current index in 'array'.

    gt : str
        An alias for ">" in Brainfuck.

    lt : str
        An alias for "<" in Brainfuck.

    plus : str
        An alias for "+" in Brainfuck.

    minus : str
        An alias for "-" in Brainfuck.

    period : str
        An alias for "." in Brainfuck.

    comma : str
        An alias for "," in Brainfuck.

    lbracket : str
        An alias for "[" in Brainfuck.

    rbracket : str
        An alias for "]" in Brainfuck.

    def execute(self, code):
        """
        A wrapper around the ``interpret`` method that allows an
        interpreter to perform other actions before or after actually
        interpreting and executing the passed in Brainfuck code.

        The base method only calls ``interpret``, which is perfectly valid.
        However, if the interpreter intends to do anything else beforehand
        or afterwords, then override this method.

        Parameters
        ----------
        code : str
            The piece of Brainfuck code to be interpreted.

        Returns
        -------
        A boolean indicating whether or not characters were sent to STDOUT

        Parameters
        ----------
        side : str

        This boolean is used for formatting purposes when the user is typing
