This module optimizes propositional logic (“boolean expressions”, in
programming language terms). Given an AST in the form of tagged
tuples, it produces an equivalent disjunctive-normal formula that is
minimal.

For the curious and bored, it uses the Quine-McCluskey algorithm.

The code was written as part of an internship at NBN in Cape Town,
South Africa in 2005.
