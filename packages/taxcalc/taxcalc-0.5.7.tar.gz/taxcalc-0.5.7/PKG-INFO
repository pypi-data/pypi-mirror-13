        Tax-Calculator
        ==============
        
        The Tax-Calculator simulates the US federal individual income tax
        system.  In conjunction with micro data that represent the US
        population and a set of behavioral assumptions, the Tax-Calculator can
        be used to conduct revenue scoring and distributional analyses of tax
        policies.  The Tax-Calculator is written in Python, an interpreted
        language that can execute on Windows, Mac, or Linux.

        ==========
        
        Results will change as the underlying models improve. A fundamental
        reason for adopting open source methods in this project is so that
        people from all backgrounds can contribute to the models that our
        society uses to assess economic policy; when community-contributed
        improvements are incorporated, the model will produce different
        results.
        
        Getting Started
        ===============
        
        At the moment there are two ways to start using the Tax-Calculator.
        
        The first way is install the Tax-Calculator on your computer.  Do this
        by following the instructions in our [Contributor
        Guide](http://taxcalc.readthedocs.org/en/latest/contributor_guide.html).
        
        The second way is to access the Tax-Calculator through our web
        application, [TaxBrain](http://www.ospc.org/taxbrain).
        
        Conda Package for Advanced Anaconda Users
        =========================================
        
        Conda taxcalc packages are created for every release of the Tax-Calculator.
        We use them to install taxcalc on Amazon Web Services (AWS) instances that
        run the TaxBrain web application.  You can get the latest release of the
        Tax-Calculator to run on your computer via the command
        `conda install -c ospc taxcalc`.  Note that this package does not include
        a micro data set that represents the US population.
