### Credits

First of all thanks to the [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/) core team and to all the contributors of [Django REST Framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/) for their amazing work. Also I would like to thank [Marc Gibbons](https://github.com/marcgibbons) for his *django-rest-framework-docs* project. Both projects share the same idea, it is just that Marc's is not maintained anymore and does not support DRF 3+ & Python 3.
