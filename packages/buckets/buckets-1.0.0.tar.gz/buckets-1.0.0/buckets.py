#Buckets:
A python module to manage data. A bucket is a place holder
for data. And with Buckets you can manage multiple bucket lists.

A bucket list is a fixed size list of buckets. When data exceeds the bucket
list, the oldest data gets moved to a lower priority bucket list if there
exists, else it gets chunked.

Example:
    A simple example of using buckets.

    import buckets

    # This initializes the Buckets class with 2 bucket lists of size 5 and 4.
    bkts = buckets.Buckets(2, [5,4])

    # To add to the buckets simply call
    bkts.buckets_add_element(<data>)
