Description: OpenID Provider
        ===============
        
        Turn your Django app into an OpenID Provider!
        
        This app is a fork of the original django-openid-provider package. For now, it
        remains API compatible with the original, documented at:
        http://django-openid-provider.readthedocs.org/. This fork is actively maintained
        by Pebble and, as such, will remain compatible with the latest Django versions.
