OpenID Provider
===============

Turn your Django app into an OpenID Provider!

This app is a fork of the original django-openid-provider package. For now, it
remains API compatible with the original, documented at:
http://django-openid-provider.readthedocs.org/. This fork is actively maintained
by Pebble and, as such, will remain compatible with the latest Django versions.
