Description: # Helper routines for using multiple, inexpensive cameras
        
        Brandon Jackson and Dennis Evangelista, 2014-2015
        
        Eventually setup cloneable Bitbucket repository::
        
            hg --clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/devangel77b/argus
        
        To install the module, run (as administrator)::
        
            python setup.py install
        
        This also works although it only gives last stable::
        
            sudo pip install argus
        
        ##Description
        
        Argus had 1000 eyes.  You might only have 3 cameras but hopefully this is
        useful.
        
        This Python module includes helper routines for calibrating, synchronizing, 
        and using multiple inexpensive cameras for reconstructing 3D positions for
        scientific uses, such as in biology, biomechanics, ecology, etc. This module
        includes chessboard calibration, automatic wand tracking, and synchronization
        using sound and is intended to interface with the python sba sparse bundle
        adjustment routines for 3D calibration and reconstruction. 
        
        Companion Matlab routines are also available.
        
        If these routines are helpful in your work, please cite Jackson, Evangelista, Hedrick (in preparation), Catchy title here, Prestigous Journal of Something VV:pp-pp::

        ## Still to do:
        
        Autowand and keypoint finder for automatic detection of extrinsic calibration 
        points.  Also provide worked example with sparse bundle adjustment (sba is 
        part of the Python sba library / or is implemented in Matlab in EasyWand).
