        Usage
        =====
        
        Just run Snipping like this,
        
        ::
        
            $ snipping
        
        Also you can specify the snippet file.
        
        If the file exists, Snipping will read the content, and save to the file
        when you ``Save``, if not, Snipping will start from empty snippet, and
        save to the file on command.
        
        ::
        
            $ snipping [path/to/snippet]
