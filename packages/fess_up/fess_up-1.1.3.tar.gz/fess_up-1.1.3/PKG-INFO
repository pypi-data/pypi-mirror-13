Description: Fess Up is an unintelligent DNS record
        guesser. It offers both a library and a command line tool to scan
        specific domains for (currently) one layer of subdomains. The scan is
        dictionary based and it will attempt to avoid superfluous queries by
        basing subsequent queries off of previously discovered records.
