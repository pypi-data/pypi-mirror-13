Veusz 1.23.2
------------
http://home.gna.org/veusz/

Veusz is a scientific plotting package.  It is designed to produce
publication-ready Postscript, PDF or SVG output. Graphs are built-up
by combining plotting widgets. The user interface aims to be simple,
consistent and powerful.

Veusz provides GUI, Python module, command line, scripting, DBUS and
SAMP interfaces to its plotting facilities. It also allows for
manipulation and editing of datasets. Data can be captured from
external sources such as Internet sockets or other programs.

Changes in 1.23.2:
 * Add data clipping dataset plugin
 * Fix boxplot with manual settings
 * Fix plugin normalize and divide by maximum for new numpy versions
 * Avoid error in 2d data creation
 * Fix problems with unicode characters in plugins in Python 2.x
 * Clip axis to sensible range -1e100->1e100
 * Handle unicode errors from operating system in Veusz scripts
 * Handle unicode errors in error reports
 * Fix crash in \color

Changes in 1.23.1:
 * Enable compression in exported files (Benjamin K. Stuhl)
 * Fix saving histogram datasets
 * Add option to "thin" error bars plotted
 * Fix label colour in contour labelling
 * Remove use of deprecated Qt functions
 * Fix clone widget tools plugin
 * Fix EPS/PDF crash with broken axis widget
 * Do not crash filter plugin if using date datatype
 * Avoid crashes in normalise, subtract minimum and divide maximum plugins
 * Avoid crash in image widget
 * Avoid issue in identifying spacing in 1D->2D conversion
 * Add Gnuplot 2D data import plugin (Joerg Meyer)
 * When loading data from import plugins, provide default values
 * Remove some deprecated Qt uses
 * Fix issue when plotting non-plain datasets with nan values

Changes in 1.23:
 * Add new export dialog box which can export multiple pages and
   modify the export options
 * Add new dataset filtering dialog
 * Add cubehelix() functional colormap
 * Add -stepN suffix for colormaps to make arbitrary numbers of steps
 * Fix incorrect colors in log images and log color scales
 * Fix unsafe commands not being run

Minor changes
 * Fix incorrect use of None in (x,...) pattern
 * Catch crash if plotting nan/inf value in log space
 * Fix getData in dataset plugin for dimensions=2
 * Catch error in too large float to date time conversion
 * Catch disappeared file during import
 * Index error fixed in pickable
 * Catch error in data edit dialog if 2d dataset size changes
 * If root widget is selected with others, do not error on hide
 * Fix undo for dataset histogram with a single output dataset
 * Fix error resizing ellipse with a tuple width, height or position setting
 * Only use finite values in histogram
 * Rewrite Line/FillSet setting controls for internal consistency and to fix
   new style extended fills
 * Do not crash with log date-time axes
 * Also ignore non-finite values when fitting with minuit
 * Avoid syntax error with invalid colormap
 * Updates to setup.py and desktop files
 * Recreate dataset now works if dialog hasn't been opened already
 * Restore dock layout when using Python3
 * Fix undo after loading stylesheet/custom definitions
 * Support unicode example filenames
 * Clip bezier lines to avoid problems with log axes
