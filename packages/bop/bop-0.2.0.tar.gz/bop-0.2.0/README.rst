Parses output from Boa_ in Python! :thumbsup:

**Note**: This is **not** a Boa client! (I would have come up with
a egregious snake pun had I made that).

.. _Boa: http://boa.cs.iastate.edu/

Install
-------

Install using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install bop


Example
-------

Using the data `viewable here`__:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import bop
    >>> with open('boa-job-output.txt') as f:
    ...     results = bop.parse(f, weighted=True)
    ...
    >>> results
    {'c#': '145', 'python': '127', 'php': '358', 'c': ...}
