Cloudmesh Client
==============================================================

Cloudmesh client is a simple client to enable access to multiple cloud
environments form a command shell and commandline. It is grown out of
the need to simplify access to multiple clouds for researchers and students
easily. In contrast to our earlier versions of cloudmesh it explicitly
separates the code to only target client code. Due to this simplification
it is also possible to install the client code not only on Linux, OSX, but
also Windows. We have tested the installation on Windows 10.
