        ========================

        pdbi is an improvment on ipdb which is a Python Debugger that exports IPython functionality.
        The improvements are aimed at more powerful debugging as well as fixing useless commands.
        
        Example usage:
        ::
        
                import pdbi; pdbi.set_trace()
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        * 'cf' command (continue forever) will continue execution until the end of the program.
        * 'c' command argument that allows to decide the number of breakpoints to continue over. 'c 2'
        * 'n' command argument that allows to decide the number of lines to execute. 'n 2' [Stops when a frame returns]
        * New 'e' command that will open an editor (Notepad++ on Windows, VIM or VI on Unix) on the current debugger line, then when the editor is closed, the debugger shows the difference and restarts the program (Based on sys.argv).
        * Allow the usage of ipython magics like 'func?' or 'func?@' etc.
        * All updated commands allow pythonic arguments for example 'c len(cmd_list)' or 'n abc'.
        * 'l' command updated to allow giving only one argument that shows that argument amount of lines around the current line.
        * 'll' command that is a shortcut to show the current line the debugger is on.
        * 'restart' command that is used to restart the program based on sys.argv.
        * 'cls/clear' command that clears the screen.
        * Added ability to force ignore commands by prefixing the command with an '!'. For example '!cls' or '!e'.
