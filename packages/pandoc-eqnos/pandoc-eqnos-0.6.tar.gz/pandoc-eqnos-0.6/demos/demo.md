What is this?
$$ y = mx + b $$ {#eq:line}
Equation @eq:line describes a straight line.

More generally, the equation for a  polynomial is
$$ \begin{aligned}
     y &= a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3 + \dots \\
     &= \sum_i a_i x^i
   \end{aligned}
$$ {#eq:polynomial}

Equations {@eq:line}--{@eq:polynomial} are known to all math students.

Equations like
$$ y = A e^{-\gamma t}\cos(2\pi f t) $$
can be left unnumbered if we do not need to refer to them.  It is also possible to number equations generically without planning to refer to them; e.g.:
$$ \pi = 3.141592653589793238462643\dots $$ {#eq:}
and
$$ e =   2.718281828459045235360287\dots $$ {#eq:}
