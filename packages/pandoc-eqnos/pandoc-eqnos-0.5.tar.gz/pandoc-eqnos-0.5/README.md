pandoc-eqnos
=============

*pandoc-eqnos* is a [pandoc] filter for numbering equations and equation references.

Demonstration: Using [`demo.md`] as input gives output files in [pdf], [tex], [html], [epub], [md] and other formats.

This version of pandoc-eqnos was tested using pandoc 1.15.0.5 and is known to work under linux, Mac OS X and Windows.

Rationale
---------

Equation numbers and references are required for academic writing, but are not currently supported by pandoc.  It is anticipated that this will eventually change.  Pandoc-eqnos is a transitional package for those who need equation numbers and references now.

The syntax for equation numbers and references was worked out in [pandoc issue #813].  It seems likely that this will be close to what pandoc ultimately adopts.

By doing one thing -- and one thing only -- my hope is that pandoc-eqnos will permit a relatively painless switch when pandoc provides native support for equation numbers and references.

Installation of the filter is straight-forward, with minimal dependencies.  It is simple to use and has been tested extensively.

Markdown Syntax
---------------

To tag an equation with the label `eq:description`, use

    $$ y = mx + b $$ {#eq:description}

The prefix `#eq:` is required whereas `description` can be replaced with any combination of letters, numbers, dashes, slashes and underscores.

To reference the equation, use

    @eq:description

or

    {@eq:description}

Curly braces around a reference are stripped from the output.


Usage
-----

To apply the filter, use the following option with pandoc:

    --filter pandoc-eqnos

Note that any use of the `--filter pandoc-citeproc` or `--bibliography=FILE` options with pandoc should come *after* the pandoc-eqnos filter call.


Details
-------

For tex/pdf output, LaTeX's native `equation` environment and `\label` and `\ref` macros are used; for all others the numbers are hard-coded.

Links are constructed for html and pdf output.


Installation
------------

Pandoc-eqnos requires [python], a programming language that comes pre-installed on linux and Mac OS X, and which is easily installed [on Windows].  Either python 2.7 or 3.x will do.

Install pandoc-eqnos as root using the bash command

    pip install pandoc-eqnos

To upgrade to the most recent release, use

    pip install --upgrade pandoc-eqnos 

Pip is a script that downloads and installs modules from the Python Package Index, [PyPI].  It should come installed with your python distribution.  If you are running linux, pip may be bundled separately.  For example, on a Debian-based system (including Ubuntu), you can install it as root using

    apt-get update
    apt-get install python-pip

[on Windows]: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
[PyPI]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi
