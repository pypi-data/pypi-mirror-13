        ============
        
        Simple blogging application
        ---------------------------
        
        **django-blawg** is a very basic blogging app that was mainly made to
        practice generic views and mixins. It supports multiple blogs
        for users, date-based listings and comments. An already existing
        user authentication system is assumed and utilized. **django-blawg** is
        not optimized or built for large-scale usage.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        - Download and install from PyPI:
        
        .. code::
        
            pip install django-blawg
        
        This will also install `django-mptt` and `django-autoslug`, as they are dependencies.
        
        - Add it to your `INSTALLED_APPS`, as well as `'mptt'`:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                ...
                'mptt',
                ...
                'blawg',
                ...
            )
        
        - Include the urlconf of the app in your project's urls.py:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from django.conf.urls import url, include
        
            urlpatterns = [
                ...
                url(r'blog/', include('blawg.urls', namespace='blawg')),
                ...
            ]
        
        Of course, you can put it under any url you want,
        like `r''` or `r'^mysite/myblog/'`.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        The starting URL is some user's username, his home page, which lists
        the user's blogs. The root URL redirects to the currently logged in
        user's home page.
        
        Settings
        --------
        
        All of the app settings are optional but you may want to modify them
        to customize to your needs.
        
        - `BLAWG_TITLE_MAX_LENGTH`: Maximum allowed characters for blog and entry title.
        
            Default: `100`
        
        - `BLAWG_DESCRIPTION_MAX_LENGTH`: Maximum allowed characters for blog description.
        
            Default: `200`
        
        - `BLAWG_GUEST_NAME_MAX_LENGTH`: Maximum allowed characters for anonymous commenter name.
        
            Default: `30`
        
        - `BLAWG_FORBIDDEN_SLUGS`: List of words not allowed to be used as slugs.
        
            Default: `['create', 'update', 'delete']`
        
        - `BLAWG_SLUG_MODIFIER`: String to be appended to an invalid slug.
        
            Default: `'-'`
