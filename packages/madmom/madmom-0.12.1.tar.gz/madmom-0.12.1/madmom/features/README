This package includes higher level features. Your definition of "higher" may
vary, but all "lower" level features can usually be found in madmom.audio.*

All features should be implemented as classes which inherit from Processor
(or provide a XYZProcessor(Processor) variant). This way, multiple Processor
objects can be chained/combined to achieve the wanted functionality.
