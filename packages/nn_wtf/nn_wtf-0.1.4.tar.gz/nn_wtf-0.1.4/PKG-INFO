Description: # nn-wtf - Neural Networks Wrapper for TensorFlow
        
        nn-wtf aims at providing a convenience wrapper to Google's 
        [TensorFlow](http://www.tensorflow.org/) machine learning library. 
        Its focus is on making neural networks easy to set up, train and use.
        
        The library is in pre-alpha right now and does not do anything useful yet.
