Description: nn-wtf - Neural Networks Wrapper for TensorFlow
        ===============================================
        
        nn-wtf aims at providing a convenience wrapper to Google's
        `TensorFlow <http://www.tensorflow.org/>`__ machine learning library.
        Its focus is on making neural networks easy to set up, train and use.
        
        The library is in pre-alpha right now and does not do anything useful
        yet.
        
        If you want to try it on MNIST data though, try this sample program:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from nn_wtf.input_data import read_data_sets, read_one_image_from_url
            from nn_wtf.mnist_graph import MNISTGraph
        
            import tensorflow as tf
        
            data_sets = read_data_sets('.')
            graph = MNISTGraph(
                learning_rate=0.1, hidden1=64, hidden2=64, hidden3=16, train_dir='.'
            )
            graph.train(data_sets, max_steps=5000, precision=0.95)
        
            image_data = read_one_image_from_url(
                'http://github.com/lene/nn-wtf/blob/master/nn_wtf/data/7_from_test_set.raw?raw=true'
            )
            prediction = graph.predict(image_data)
            assert prediction == 7
        
        From there on, you are on your own for now. More functionality and
        documentation to come.
