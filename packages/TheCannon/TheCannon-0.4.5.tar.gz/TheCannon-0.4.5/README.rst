TheCannon
=========

This is the code associated with *The Cannon*, a new data-driven method for 
determining stellar labels (physical parameters and chemical abundances) from
stellar spectra in the context of vast spectroscopic surveys. It closely 
follows the method outlined in Ness et al. 2015, although some minor changes 
have been made. A list of these changes will be outlined in Ho et al. 
(in prep.)

Documentation for The Cannon can be found here_.
