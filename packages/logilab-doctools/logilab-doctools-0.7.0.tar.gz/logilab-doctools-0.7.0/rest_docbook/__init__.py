ReStructured Text to XML DocBook Converter.

This converter relies on Docutils module to read the ReST date. It provides
a Docutils Visitor and a Docutils Writer for the conversion into an XML tree
containing DocBook elements. The XML tree is built thanks to the lxml library.

Here are defined the high-level functions that can transform ReST data into 
XML DocBook data.
