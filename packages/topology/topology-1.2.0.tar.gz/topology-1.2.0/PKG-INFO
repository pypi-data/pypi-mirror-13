        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.2.0
        -----
        
        **New**
        
        - Added new API for the topology nodes that allow to set the default shell.
          For example, you may now use ``mynode.default_shell = 'bash'``.
        - Documentation for the *Attribute Injection* feature was added.
        - Improvements for file matching in attribute injection files. Now, if using
          pytest, all test folders passed as arguments will be used as search paths for
          relative files specified in the attribute injection file. With this, it is no
          longer required to use an absolute path, and this practice becomes deprecated.
        
        **Fixes**
        
        - Fixed a bug in attribute injection when using ``attribute=value`` as node
          identifier that caused all nodes with the attribute to use that value.
        
        1.1.0
        -----
        
        **New**
        
        - Added a common ``stateprovider`` decorator to ``topology.libraries.utils``
          that allows to easily inject state to an enode in a Communication library.
        - Added a common ``NodeLoader`` class to ``topology.platforms.utils`` that
          allows a Platform Engine to find a load nodes for it's platform.
        
        1.0.1
        -----
        
        **Fixes**
        
        - Fixed fatal bug when running a single node topology without ports.
        - Fixed new PEP8 checks on the codebase.
        
        1.0.0
        -----
        
        - Initial public release.
