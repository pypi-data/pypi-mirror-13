Description: Google API Extensions for Python
        ================================
        
        Google API Extensions for Python (gax-python) is a set of libraries which
        aids the development of APIs for clients and servers based on `GRPC`_ and
        Google API conventions.
        
        Application code will rarely need to use most of the classes within this
        library directly, but code generated automatically from the API definition
        files in `GOOGLE APIS`_ can use services such as page streaming and request bundling to provide
        a more convenient and idiomatic API surface to callers.

        Versioning
        ----------
        
        This library follows `Semantic Versioning`_
        
        It is currently in major version zero (``0.y.z``), which means that anything
        may change at any time and the public API should not be considered
        stable.
