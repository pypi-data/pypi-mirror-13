        Use ``pyrecommend`` in Django projects. 
        
        **Warning:** not yet suitable for production.
        
        ``django_recommend/`` is the actual Django app intended for use in projects.
        
        ``simplerec/`` is a Django project used for testing.
        
        **Important note:** Model classes/database schemas are only supported if they
        have unique integer primary keys.
        
        
        Quickstart
        ----------
        
        * Add ``django_recommend`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``, and run
          ``python manage.py migrate``.
        
        * Set ``SESSION_SAVE_EVERY_REQUEST=True`` in your settings, to ensure anonymous
          users can be tracked.
        
        * In your views, call ``django_recommend.set_score(request, object, score)`` to
          start recording user scores. (Currently this is assumed to be implicit
          feedback.) **Note:** This will use session keys to store scores for users who
          aren't authenticated.
        
        * In your templates, use ``{% load django_recommend %}`` and
          ``{{ obj|similar_objects }}`` to show similar objects to visitors. This
          filter returns a list, so you may also do, for example:
        
          .. code:: html+django
        
              {% load django_recommend %}
              {% with similar_products as product|similar_objects %}
                  {% if similiar_products %}
                      <h2>Other users also liked:</h2>
                      <ul>
                      {% for product in similar_products %}
                          <li><a href="{{ product.get_absolute_url }}">{{ product }}</a></li>
                      {% endfor %}
                      </ul>
                  {% endif %}
              {% endwith %}
        
        
        
        Notes
        -----
        
        There can be some potentially confusing behavior from this library if your
        application involves objects that get deleted/deactivated. Currently I am not
        sure how feasible it is to filter by a flag like 'deactivated'; tests for that
        kind of functionality will be put into a future version.
        
        If your data is ever deleted, by default, ``django_recommend`` will attempt to
        delete all recommendation information about it at the next available chance.
        This most notably can occur in ``ObjectSimilarityQueryset.get_instances_for``,
        where you may, for example, have a queryset like::
        
            suggested_books = similar_books.order_by(
                '-score')[:5].get_instances_for(curr_book)
        
        If one of the books that *would* be suggested for this book has since been
        deleted, the default behavior will be to in fact give you a list of *four*
        instances. This is because retrieving the deleted instances raises an
        ``ObjectDoesNotExist`` error in the Django ORM; the default behavior is to
        simply delete that object's information from the recommendation data and skip
        the object for now.
        
        This can be controlled by the ``RECOMMEND_PURGE_MISSING_DATA`` boolean setting.
        If this is ``False``, the exception will be propagated, so you may handle it in
        a different way.
