Description: BuffaloFQ - a method of moving files via a file system queue
        ============================================================
        
        The objective of BuffaloFQ is to provide a very simple and reliable
        method of moving files around an architecture.
        
        Installation:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        $ mkvirtualenv buffalofq\_cpy $ pip install buffalofq --upgrade
        
        Configuration:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Most configuration is handled through a simple yaml file, that is kept
        in the xdg-compliant config directory. On linux this would be:
        
        -  $HOME/.config/buffalofq\_mover/[config-name1].yml
        -  $HOME/.config/buffalofq\_mover/[config-name2].yml
        -  $HOME/.config/buffalofq\_mover/[config-name3].yml
        
        Config example:
        
        -  name: ids\_to\_load #
        -  status: enabled # choices are: enabled, disabled
        -  polling\_seconds: 60 # delay in seconds between checks for new files
        -  limit\_total: -1 # choices: -1 (run continuously), 0 (run until
           source\_dir is empty), [some number] run until this number have been
           moved.
        -  port: 22 #
        -  key\_filename: id\_auto # your ssh key
        -  log\_dir: /data/logs # location buffalofq\_mover will write its logs
        -  log\_level: debug # choices are: info, warning, error, critical
        -  sort\_key: time # choices are: None, name, or name of a field within
           filename
        -  source\_host: localhost # must be localhost at this time
        -  source\_user: bobsmith # not yet used
        -  source\_dir: /data/output #
        -  source\_fn: '\*' # wild-card for selecting source files
        -  source\_post\_dir: /data/archive #
        -  source\_post\_action: move # choices: move, delete, pass
        -  dest\_host: datawarehouse #
        -  dest\_user: bobsmith # used to log into dest\_host
        -  dest\_dir: /data/input #
        -  dest\_fn: '' # needed if dest\_post\_action == symlink
        -  dest\_post\_dir: None # not used yet
        -  dest\_post\_action: pass # choices: pass, symlink
        
        Run:
        ~~~~
        
        To run once, you can simply run it like:
        
        -  $ ./buffalofq\_mover --config-name [config-name1]
        
        A trivial way to keep it running continuously:
        
        -  $ nohup ./buffalofq\_mover --config-name [config-name1] &
        
        
        
        0.0.2 - initial genuinely usable working version - add ability to
        receive files in order of their name, or any field within the name - add
        ability to provide name of ssh key to use - rename audit file &
        buffalofq program to buffalofq\_mover - misc general improvements and
        refactorings
        
        0.0.1 - initial working version
