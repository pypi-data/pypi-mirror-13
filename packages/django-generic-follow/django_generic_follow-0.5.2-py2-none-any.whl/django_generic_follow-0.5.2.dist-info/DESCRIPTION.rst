Django Generic Follow
=====================

|Build Status|

django-generic-follow is a system to allow users to follow any model in
a Django project.

Installation / Setup
--------------------

Basics
~~~~~~

First, install the package with pip

.. code:: bash

    pip install django-generic-follow

Then add ``generic_follow`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``

.. code:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...,
        'generic_follow',
    )

User Model
~~~~~~~~~~

If you are using the ``auth.User`` user model, the user instance methods
will be set up for you. If you are using a custom User model, you will
need to apply the ``UserFollowMixin``

.. code:: python

    from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser
    from generic_follow.model_mixins import UserFollowMixin

    class MyCustomUser(UserFollowMixin, AbstractUser):
        ...

Target Models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add the convenience methods to models that will be followed apply the
``TargetFollowMixin``

.. code:: python

    from django.db import models
    from generic_follow.model_mixins import TargetFollowMixin


    class Band(TargetFollowMixin, models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=255)

Usage
-----

Follow/Unfollow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To make a user follow a model instance use the ``user.follow`` method

.. code:: python

    user = User.objects.first()
    band = Band.objects.get(name='Foals')

    user.follow(band)

To make a user unfollow a model instance simply call ``user.unfollow``

.. code:: python

    user.unfollow(band)

Checking if a user currently follows a model instance involves calling
``user.is_following``

.. code:: python

    user.is_following(band)
    # true/false

Retrieval Methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To see all model instances that a user is following call the
``user.get_follow_set`` method.

.. code:: python

    user.get_follow_set()
    # [<Band: foals>]

Optionally, the ``model`` kwarg can be provided to only return followed
instances of that model type

.. code:: python

    user.get_follow_set(Photographer)
    # []

On the follow target, ``model.get_follower_set`` can be called to
retrieve all followers

.. code:: python

    band.get_follower_set()

Batch Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To make a list of users follow a given model instance call the
``create_batch`` manager method

.. code:: python

    user2 = ...

    Follow.objects.create_batch(users=[user, user2], target=band)

To perform the inverse, call the ``delete_batch`` manager method

.. code:: python

    Follow.objects.delete_batch(users=[user, user2], target=band)

To make some users follow a model instance, and others unfollow the same
model instance in the same command, use ``update_batch``. The
``users_follow`` kwarg accepts a 2-tuple of user instance, and a boolean
indicating if this user should be following the instance.

.. code:: python

    Follow.objects.update_batch(
        target=band,
        users_follow=[(user, True), (user2, False)]
    )
    # user will now be following foals, user2 will now not be following foals

Signals
~~~~~~~

Batch operations emit signals which can be used elsewhere in your
project.

``follow_bulk_create``: Sent after ``Follow.objects.create_batch()``
completes

``follow_bulk_delete``: Sent after ``Follow.objects.delete_batch()``
completes

These signals send ``users`` and ``target`` as kwargs.

Connecting to these signals is the same as any other Django signal

.. code:: python

    def bulk_create_callback(sender, **kwargs):
        ...

    from generic_follow.signals import follow_bulk_create    
    follow_bulk_create.connect(bulk_create_callback, sender=Follow)
