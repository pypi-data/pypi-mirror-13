Pyminc is a python interface to the MINC 2 library, allowing use of numpy arrays to 
access MINC data, and other such similar goodies, developed by Jason Lerch.

Requirements:

Pyminc is compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3.  It requires numpy (the python numerical arrays package) to work;
this can be installed automatically from PyPI via setuptools. Also, it needs MINC2 compiled as a shared object
and accessible through the standard search paths.  For the tests, you also need the `minc-tools` suite
of command-line utilities.

Currently pyminc is geared towards the develop branch of libminc, because that is the 
version of MINC that is installed through the minc-toolkit (https://github.com/BIC-MNI/minc-toolkit).
There are some substantial differences between that branch and the master branch of 
libminc in terms of the argument types of several functions.

Installing pyminc:

Pyminc is installable from PyPI via setuptools, pip, etc.  To install from source:

1) Untar the tarball if applicable
2) Run 'python setup.py install' with an optional --prefix if you want to install it in a non-default location.
3) Test the installation. To test the installation of pyminc library, run "python setup.py test".
   At your option, also run the pyminc_test2.py script in the scripts folder. This program has 3 arguments:
   a minc file, a method for smoothing the volume (numpy, blitz or weave) and an output file name.
