DeadlineConnection
==================
Wraps ``Deadline.DeadlineConnect.DeadlineCon`` providing additional
functionality. Can be used as a ContextManager::

    with DeadlineConnection('localhost', 8080) as c:
        best_pool = c.get_best_pool(prefix='maya')

Here we get the best possible pool for the next job submission with the
prefix *maya*.
