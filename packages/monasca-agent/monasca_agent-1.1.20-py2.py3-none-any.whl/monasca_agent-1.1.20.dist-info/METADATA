# Introduction
The Monasca Agent is a modern Python monitoring agent for gathering metrics and sending them to the Monasca API. The Agent supports collecting metrics from a variety of sources as follows:

* System metrics such as cpu and memory utilization.
* Nagios plugins. The Monasca Agent can run Nagios plugins and send the status code returned by the plugin as a metric to the Monasca API.
* Statsd. The Monasca Agent supports an integrated Statsd daemon which can be used by applications via a statsd client library.
* Host alive. The Monasca Agent can perform active checks on a host to determine if it is alive using ping (ICMP) or 
SSH.
* Process checks. The Monasca Agent can check a process and return several metrics on the process such as number of instances, memory, io and threads.
* Http Endpoint checks. The Monasca Agent can perform active checks on http endpoints by sending an HTTP request to an API.
* Service checks. The Agent can check service such as MySQL, RabbitMQ, and many more.
* OpenStack metrics.  The agent can perform checks on OpenStack processes.
* The Agent can automatically detect and setup checks on certain processes and resources.

The Agent is extensible through configuration of additional plugins, written in Python.
