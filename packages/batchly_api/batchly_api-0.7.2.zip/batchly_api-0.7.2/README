Batchly-Api
=================
This API SDK allows you to write your own applications to manage Batchly.  All functions that can be performed via Console are available in this SDK.

How To Configure:
=================
The Auth Keys can be generated from the Batchly Console. Before executing any methods, call the Configuration utility to setup your custom endpoint, Access Key and Secret Key

How To Build:
=============
The generated code uses a package namely 'unirest'. The reference to this package is
already added in the spec. Therefore, you will need internet access to resolve
this dependency. Due to the UniRest package dependency this SDK only works under Python 2.7
It will not work using Python 3.x

How To Use:
===========
The following shows how to make invoke the AccountsController controller.
It is also shown in [2].

    1. Create a "AccountsControllerTest.py" file in the root directory.
    2. Add the following import statement
        'from BatchlyApi.Controllers.AccountsController import \*'
    3. Create a new instance using 'controller = AccountsController()'
    4. Invoke an endpoint with the appropriate parameters, for example
        'response = controller.list_projects(<required parameters if any>)'
    5. "response" will now be an object of type ProjectModel.
    6. To test the response you get, print out a property of "response",
        for example 'print response.account_id'.

[2] from BatchlyApi.Controllers.AccountsController import *

	controller = AccountsController()
    response = controller.list_projects()

    print response.account_id
    #or you can print more information
    print response.resolve_names()
