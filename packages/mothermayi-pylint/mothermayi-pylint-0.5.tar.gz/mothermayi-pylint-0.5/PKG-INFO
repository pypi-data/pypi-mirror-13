Description: mothermayi-pylint
        =================
        
        A plugin for https://github.com/EliRibble/mothermayi that runs pylint for you.
        
        Configuration
        =============
        The pylint plugin for `mothermayi` takes only a few simple options:
        
        ```yaml
        pylint:
            args:
                - --reports=no
                - --rcfile=pylint.cfg
        ```
        This simple defines the list of parameters that will be passed to pylint. The above configuration will result in `mothermayi` making the following call
        
        `pylint --reports=no --rcfile=pylint.cfg <modified files>`
        
        Where `<modified files>` is the list of filenames that will be committed.
