**Cortical.io's Retina API** allows the user to perform semantic operations on text. One can 
for example:

* measure the semantic similarity between two written entities
* create a semantic classifier based on positive and negative example texts
* extract keywords from a text
* divide a text into sub-sections corresponding to semantic changes
* extract terms from a text based on part of speech tags

The meaning of terms and texts is stored in a sparse binary representation that allows the user to apply logical 
operators to refine the semantic representation of a concept.

You can read more about the technology at the `documentation page <http://documentation.cortical.io/intro.html>`_.

To access the API, you will need to register for an `API key  <http://www.cortical.io/resources_apikey.html>`_.
