Description: Panedr
        ======
        
        |Build Status|
        
        Panedr reads a Gromacs EDR file and returns its content as a pandas
        dataframe. The library exposes one function—the ``edr_to_df``
        function—that gets the path to an EDR file and returns a pandas
        dataframe.
        
        The pandas library is required.
        
        Example
        -------
        
        .. code:: python
        
            import panedr
        
            # Read the EDR file
            path = 'ener.edr'
            df = panedr.edr_to_edr(path)
        
            # Get the average pressure after the first 10 ns
            pressure_avg = df[u'Pressure'][df[u'Time'] > 1000].mean()
        
        Install
        -------
        
        The ``panedr`` module can be installed from source. The source files are
        available on Github at https://github.com/jbarnoud/panedr. Once the file
        downloaded, go to the panedr directory and run:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip install .
        
        You may not have the permissions to install modules system wide, or you
        may want to install ``panedr`` only for the current user. To install the
        module user wide only, run:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip install --user .
        
        You may want to consider
        `virtualenv <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/>`__.
        
        ``panedr`` is compatible with Python 2.7 and greater and python 3.3 and
        greater.
        
        Tests
        -----
        
        The ``panedr`` module comes with a series of tests. To run these tests,
        install `nose <https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`__, and run:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            nosetests -v panedr
