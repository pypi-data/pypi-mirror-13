pyrsl |Build Status| |Coverage Status|
======================================

pyrsl is an interpreter for a language called RSL (Rule Specification
Language). RSL is commonly used as a template language to express
transformations from a `BridgePoint <https://www.xtuml.org>`__ model
into a textual representation, e.g. when writing model compilers or
when generating html documentation from a model.

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~
pyrsl depend on pyxtuml, see its `github page
<https://github.com/john-tornblom/pyxtuml>`__ for install instructions.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install from pypi:

::

    $ python -m pip install pyrsl

Or fetch the source from github:

::

    $ git clone https://github.com/john-tornblom/pyrsl.git
    $ cd pyrsl
    $ python setup.py install
   
Optionally, you can also execute a test suite:

::

    $ python setup.py test

Windows EXEs
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Windows users may obtain `self-contained EXEs from appveyor <https://ci.appveyor.com/project/john-tornblom/pyrsl/build/artifacts>`__:

- legacy_cli.exe - legacy command line interface.
- gen_erate.exe - pythonic command line interface with a few additional features.

Usage
~~~~~
The command line usage is as follows:

::
   
    $ python -m rsl.gen_erate [options] script.arc


where script.arc is an RSL template, also known as a archetype. [options]
may be a combination of the following:


::
   
    --version               show program's version number and exit
    --help, -h              show this help message and exit
    --import=PATH, -i PATH  import model information from PATH
    --include=PATH, -I PATH
                            add PATH to list of dirs to search for include files
    --emit=WHEN, -e WHEN    choose when to emit (never, change, always)
    --force, -f             make read-only emit files writable
    --diff=PATH, -d PATH    save a diff of all emits to PATH
    --verbosity, -v         increase debug logging level
