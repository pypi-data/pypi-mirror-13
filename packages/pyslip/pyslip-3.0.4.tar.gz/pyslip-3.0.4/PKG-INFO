Description: pySlip
        ======
        
        pySlip is a 'slip map' widget for wxPython.
        
        **This is the GitHub version of the Google Code pySlip project at
        https://code.google.com/p/pyslip.
        The 2.X versions of code will remain on Google.
        The 3.X versions will be developed here on GitHub.**
        
        During my work writing geophysical applications in python I often wanted to
        display a map that was very large - many hundreds of thousands of pixels in
        width.  I searched around for a GUI solution that would work rather like Google
        maps: tiled, layers, etc.  I couldn't find anything that didn't assume
        browser+map server.  So I wrote my own wxPython widget.  This worked well for
        cartesian self-generated maps and has been extended to handle non-cartesian
        maps and tiles sourced from places like OpenStreetMap.
        
        It's a poor thing, but solves my problem.  I'm placing it here in the hope that
        someone else may find it useful.  If you find it useful, or make improvements
        to it, drop me a line.
        
        pySlip works on Linux, Mac and Windows.  It only works with wxPython 2.x and
        Python 2.x (at the moment).  At some point when wxPython matures I hope to
        move to Python 3.X and later versions of wxPython.
