Description: torex
        =====
        
        torex is an open source application for automatic torrent extraction.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        You can install through PyPi:
        
        ```bash
        pip install torex
        ```
        
        Or just download the sources (manually or clone from GitHub) and run:
        
        ```bash
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        Running
        -------
        
        The command for running torex is just `torex`.
        
        The command-line interface is:
        
        ```bash
        torex <config_path> <torrent_path> <label>
        ```
        
        Where:
        * config_path: Configuration file path
        * torrent_path: The path to the downloaded torrent
        * label: The torrent's label (will be explained later on)
        
        uTorrent Setup
        --------------
        
        The script is particularly easy to run from uTorrent. Under Preferences, go to Advanced -> Run Program.
        Then, set the program to be run:
        
        ```bash
        torex <config_path> "%D" "%L"
        ```
        
        Finally, when you add a torrent that should be extracted, just make sure it is assigned the correct label in uTorrent.
        
        Labels
        ------
        
        Supported torrent labels:
        * tv - A TV series torrent (Formatted like *Breaking Bad S01E01*)
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        The configuration file is a YAML file, that tells `torex` where it should extract the torrents to.
        You can take a look at `config_example.yaml` for an example of what a configuration file should look like.
        
        Under the label, you can define a root `path` that the torrents will be extracted to.
        Every torrent will be extracted to a subdirectory with the TV series' name.
        
        You can define an array of `special` types, each containing two fields:
        * title: A regex for matching a torrent's title
        * path: The path that these torrents should be extracted to
        
        The `special` configuration is particularly useful when you have a big drive that holds all your downloads,
        but you want some specific torrents to be extracted somewhere else.
        
        Torrent Types
        -------------
        
        Right now, the only supported torrents are torrents that are a single directory with a single `.rar`
        file to be extracted.
        
        Logs
        ----
        
        `torex` writes logs to `~/.torex/logs.txt`
