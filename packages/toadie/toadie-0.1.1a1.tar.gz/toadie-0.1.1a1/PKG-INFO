        Toadie is a microservices framework that includes everything needed to create microservices and run on a compute cluster using the ambassador pattern. Compute cluster can be Elastic Container Service, Kubernetes, or similar. Toadie supports the concepts of `service` and `task`.
        
            * Service: Long-running application or worker
            * Task: Short-running application or worker, which often requires additional compute resorces be added to cluster
        
        Toadie is designed with analytic processes and smaller teams in mind.
        
        Toadie is inspired by django and rails and gummi bears.

        Getting Started
        ###############
        
        1. Install toadie at the command prompt if you haven't yet using either `pip` or `conda`:
        
            .. code:: shell
        
                # using pip
                $ pip install toadie
                # using conda
                $ conda install -c https://conda.anaconda.org/gonzo toadie
        
        2. Install required development tools:
        
            .. code:: shell
        
               $ toadie ready-system
        
        3. At the command prompt, create a new toadie project and add a `service`:
        
            .. code:: shell
        
               $ toadie create-project myproject
               $ cd myproject
               $ toadie create-service myservice
        
            where "myproject" is the project name and where "myservice" is the name of your service.
        
        4. Start your stack locally:
        
            .. code:: shell
        
               $ honcho start up
        
        5. Deploy your stack on your chosen cloud:
        
            .. code:: shell
        
               $ toadie deploy
