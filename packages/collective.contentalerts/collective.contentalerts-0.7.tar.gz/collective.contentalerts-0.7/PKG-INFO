        ========================
        collective.contentalerts
        ========================
        Get alerts whenever a (custom list of) word is found on a content object,
        be that object any content type (Dexterity, Archetypes or comments).
        
        Can be used to:
        
        - moderate: used as a blacklist.
        - highlight: used as a whitelist.
        
        The basic idea is to use the power of `plone.app.contentrules`_ to inspect
        content being generated by users for certain words.
        
        Upon that, regular `plone.app.contentrules`_ actions can be triggered:
        send an email, notify the user, apply a workflow transition...
        
        Features
        --------
        - manage a list of words that will be used to search (blacklist/whitelist)
        - integration with  `plone.app.contentrules`_:
        
          - a condition to look for stop words
          - string substitutions to add on emails the snippets where the stop words
            where found (one for documents and one for comments)
        
        - standalone utility
        - provide different word lists if you need them,
          either a general one (plone.registry based) or on a per contentrule basis
        - look for stop words on comments, dexterity and archetypes content types
        - apply a marker interface to objects that are found to have stop words
        - mark objects as reviewed
        - monitor the list of words for changes and search for the new stop words on already reviewed objects
        
          - if ``[async]]`` extra is enable this review will be done via an asynchronous job (vi `collective.taskqueue`_)
        
        Where it searches on
        --------------------
        collective.contentalerts searches either on the comments' text,
        on ``getText()`` (for Archetypes based content types) or
        on ``text`` (for Dexterity based content types).
        
        Standalone usage
        ----------------
        While the main integration within Plone is via a p.a.contentrules condition,
        ``collective.contentalerts`` can also be used as a standalone utility.
        
        Just get the utility (``collective.contentalerts.interfaces.IAlert``) and use
        the provided methods.
