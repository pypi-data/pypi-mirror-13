Dependencies
============

* **Required:** A
  [**GNU/Linux**](http://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html) or [**Mac
  OS**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS) operating system.

* **Required:** A [**python**](http://www.python.org) version from 2.6 up
  to, but not including, 3.0.
 
* **Required:** The [**python psutil
  package**](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/psutil) at version 0.6.0 or
  newer (the latest version is recommended).

* **Required:** The [**python numpy
  package**](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/numpy) at version 1.7 or
  newer.

* **Required:** The [**python matplotlib
  package**](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/matplotlib) at version 1.4.2
  or newer.

* **Required:** The [**python netCDF4
  package**](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/netCDF4) at version 1.1.1 or
  newer, *but not version 1.2*. This package requires the
  [**netCDF**](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf),
  [**HDF5**](http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5) and
  [**zlib**](ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf/netcdf-4)
  libraries.

* **Required:** The [**UNIDATA Udunits-2
  library**](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/udunits). This is a
  C library which provides support for units of physical
  quantities. If The Udunits-2 shared library file
  (``libudunits2.so.0`` on GNU/Linux or ``libudunits2.0.dylibfile`` on
  Mac OS) is in a non-standard location then its path should be added
  to the ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` environment variable.

* **Optional:** For regridding to work, the [**ESMF
  package**](https://www.earthsystemcog.org/projects/esmf) is
  required. If this package is not installed then regridding will not
  work, but all other cf-python functionality will be unaffected. See
  the file [**ESMF.md**](ESMF.md) for installation instructions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Visualisation
=============

The [**cfplot package**](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cfplot) at
version 1.7.15 or newer provides metadata-aware visualisation for
cf-python fields. This is not a dependency for cf-python.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation
============

To install from [**PyPI**](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cf-python):

    pip install cf-python

Note: A conda installation is in preparation.

Alternatively, to install from source:

1. Download the cf package from [**cf-python
   downloads**](https://bitbucket.org/cfpython/cf-python/downloads).
  
2. Unpack the library:
  
        tar zxvf cf-python-1.1.4.tar.gz
        cd cf-python-1.1.4

3. Install the package:
          
    * To install the cf package to a central location:
       
            python setup.py install
       
    * To install the cf package locally to the user in a default
      location:

            python setup.py install --user
      
    * To install the cf package in the ``<directory>`` of your
      choice:
      
            python setup.py install --home=<directory>

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Tests
=====

The test scripts are in the ``test`` directory. To run all tests:

    python test/run_tests.py


----------------------------------------------------------------------

Command line utilities
======================

The ``cfdump`` tool generates text representations on standard output
of the CF fields contained in the input files. 

The ``cfa`` tool creates and writes to disk the CF fields contained in
the input files.

During the installation described above, these scripts will be copied
automatically to a location given by the ``PATH`` environment
variable.

For usage instructions, use the ``-h`` option to display the manual
pages:

    cfdump -h
    cfa -h
