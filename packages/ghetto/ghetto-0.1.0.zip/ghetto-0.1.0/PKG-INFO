Description: ghetto
        ======
        
        A tool for (automatized) torrent files downloading from RSS feeds to use
        with torrent clients which don't have built-in RSS functionality.
        
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        Python 2.7 with `pip` package manager.
        
        Tested under MacOS X and Debian Linux.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
            pip install ghetto
        
        or
        
            git clone https://github.com/infinite-library/ghetto.git ghetto
            cd ghetto
            python setup.py install
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        All available options can be shown using ``ghetto`` command without any
        parameters. After creation of a new configuration it is automatically added to
        crontab of the current user to fetch feed time to time.
        
        Only those torrent files which titles are passing filters and aren't passing
        blacklist are downloaded. Comments started from ``#`` character and empty lines
        allowed.
        
        Example of filters list:
        
        ```
        # Some ongoings by HorribleSubs
        HorribleSubs*Heavy*Object*720p
        HorribleSubs*Ushio*Tora*720p
        
        # All Doki BD releases
        Doki*x1080*BD
        ```
        
        Example of blacklist:
        ```
        # E.g. we hate .mp4 containers
        *.mp4
        ```
