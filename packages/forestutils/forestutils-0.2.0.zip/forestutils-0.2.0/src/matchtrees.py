"""Tools for adjusting trees from forest-utils.py based on other datasets.

The required input to this module is a .csv file associating the name and
location of each tree in the dataset.  A prior analysis run from forest-utils
works well for this purpose if the names have been manually added at some
point, as other columns are ignored.

Data which can be corrected includes later analysis runs of forest-utils,
and the names of individual tree files output.

It may be worth moving to an iterative closest point algorithm at some point,
and matching the whole datasets at once.  More flexible input, but much more
complex code.
