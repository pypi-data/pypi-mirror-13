Repetitive command line creation with your editor of choice
===========================================================

Web: http://thp.io/2016/rpt/

Given a list of file names, this will put the list of files into a text
file, open that with $EDITOR (or $VISUAL if $EDITOR is not set). After
the editor returns, any changed names in the text file will cause a
command (default: mv) to be executed with the original and new filename.

This is very useful in carrying out rename operations that are easy to
specify with your text editor, but hard to specify with wildcards.

If you ever wrote something like this, then this tool is for you:

    for f in *.mp3; do; mv "$f" "$(basename $f .mp3)_foo.mp3"; done

Also, you can use different commands instead of "mv", and add options
for the input and output parameters ("oggenc <infile> -o <outfile>"):

    rpt --command=oggenc --output=-o *.wav

If the command requires you to put the output filename before the input,
you can use --swap to achieve this ("mpg123 -w <outfile> <infile>"):

    rpt --command=mpg123 --output=-w --swap *.mp3

Then for all files that you want to convert to ogg, just change their
extension (you can possibly also change their name inline).
