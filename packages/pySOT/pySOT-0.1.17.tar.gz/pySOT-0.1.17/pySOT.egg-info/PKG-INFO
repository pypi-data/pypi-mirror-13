Description: =============================================================
        pySOT: Surrogate Optimization Toolbox
        =============================================================
        
        pySOT is an optimization toolbox for global deterministic optimization problems.
        The main purpose of the toolbox is for optimization of computationally expensive
        black-box objective functions with continuous and/or integer variables where the
        number of evaluations is limited.
        
        The toolbox is hosted on GitHub: https://github.com/dme65/pySOT
