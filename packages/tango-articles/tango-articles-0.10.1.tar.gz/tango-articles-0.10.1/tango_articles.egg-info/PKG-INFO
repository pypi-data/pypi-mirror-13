Description: Tango Articles
        ==============
        
        [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tBaxter/tango-articles.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tBaxter/tango-articles)
        
        Tango Articles is a simple but robust reusable app for news articles and blogs entries. It can power anything from a simple blog to sophisticated full-featured news sites.
        
        While it forms a key component of Tango, it can also be dropped into an existing non-Tango project.
        
        ## Key features
        * Have as many blogs as you like running one site.
        * Have as many sections as you like.
        * Drag-and-drop photo ordering
        * Output is compliant with hnews microformat.
        
        ##Installation:
        
            pip install tango-articles
        
        or install directly from github:
        
            pip install git+https://github.com/tBaxter/tango-articles.git
        
        
        ## Usage:
        Add 'articles' and 'tango_shared' to your installed apps, then run syncdb or migrate.
        
        tango_shared and [bindings for Twitter](https://github.com/sixohsix/twitter) will be installed for you.
