Tango Articles is a simple but robust reusable app for news articles and blogs entries. It can power anything from a simple blog to sophisticated full-featured news sites.

While it forms a key component of Tango, it can also be dropped into an existing non-Tango project.

## Key features
* Have as many blogs as you like running one site.
* Have as many sections as you like.
* Drag-and-drop photo ordering
* Output is compliant with hnews microformat.

##Installation:

    pip install tango-articles

or install directly from github:

    pip install git+https://github.com/tBaxter/tango-articles.git


## Usage:
Add 'articles' and 'tango_shared' to your installed apps, then run syncdb or migrate.

tango_shared and [bindings for Twitter](https://github.com/sixohsix/twitter) will be installed for you.
