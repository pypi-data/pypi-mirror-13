ownCloud backup
===============

This project is used for uploading the backups to the ownCloud and managing old backups.

How it works
------------

By default, script expects one *file* argument, which will be uploaded to ownCloud with ``%Y.%m.%d_`` time prefix into `remote_path` directory.

When the file is uploaded, scripts requests listing of all other files in selected `remote_path`, then reads time informations from names and then removes old files.

Process of removing of old files is defined to keep following files:

- all files from last month
- one file per week for two-months-before
- one file per two weeks for three-months-before

and to remove all older files.

Configuration
-------------

There is possibility of configuration of following variables using `conf` files ``owncloud_backup.cfg`` or ``~/.owncloud_backup.cfg``::

    [Login]
    user=login@owncloud.tld
    pass=password
    url=https://owncloud.cesnet.cz

    [Config]
    remote_path=/backups
    no_timestamp=false

All values in `Config` section and `url` variable from `Login` section is optional (defaults are shown in this example).

`no_timestamp` will instruct the script to stop putting the timestamp prefix to uploaded files. In that case, it is expected that such files will contain the timestamp added manually, or they will be ignored in process of elimination of old files.

Commandline arguments
---------------------

All variables defined in configuration file may be also added using commandline arguments::

    usage: owncloud_backup.py [-h] [-u USERNAME] [-p PASSWORD] [--url URL]
                              [-r REMOTE_PATH] [-n]
                              FILENAME

    This program may be used to perform database backups into ownCloud.
    Configuration file in ini format is expected in `owncloud_backup.cfg` or
    `~/.owncloud_backup.cfg` paths.

    positional arguments:
      FILENAME              Upload FILENAME into the ownCloud.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -u USERNAME, --username USERNAME
                            Username of the ownCloud user.
      -p PASSWORD, --password PASSWORD
                            Password of the ownCloud user.
      --url URL             URL of the ownCloud service. Default
                            `https://owncloud.cesnet.cz`.
      -r REMOTE_PATH, --remote-path REMOTE_PATH
                            Path on the server. Default `/backups`.
      -n, --no-timestamp    By default, the script adds `%Y.%m.%d_` prefix to each
                            uploaded file.
