    Captures inventory information

    This polisher looks at each node in sequence, but only to retrieve
    maximum information about each of them. At the end of the process,
    the polisher writes a YAML file for future reference.

    To activate this polisher you have to mention it in the fittings plan,
    like in the following example::

        ---
        safeMode: False
        polishers:
          - spit:
              reap: nodes.yaml
          - ansible:
              reap: inventory.yaml
        ---
        # Frankfurt in Europe
        locationId: EU6
        regionId: dd-eu
        ...
