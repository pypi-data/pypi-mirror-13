        vanellope is a publishing engine (just a blog software) named after the adorable Disney character `Vanellope von Schweetz <http://disney.wikia.com/wiki/Vanellope_von_Schweetz>`_
        . It it is designed to be deployed with a minimal effort.
        
        DEMO
        ----
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
          pip install vanellope
          vanellope --port=8000
        
        
        There it is ! A brand new app is running on port 8000. You can run on port 80 or put it behind a reverse proxy like Nginx. In either way you work here is done.
        
        **REMEMBER**, after vanellope started, it will look for a `content` directory in the current location. If the directory not exist it will create one and put every thing it generated in it.
        
        And one more thing, a newly created vanellope instance is completely vulnerable like every new born baby. You should visit `/welcome` page signup as administrator immediately after the instance start running. The `/welcome` page can be used only once.Section title.
