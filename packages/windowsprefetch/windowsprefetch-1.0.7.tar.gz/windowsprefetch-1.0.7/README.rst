Windows-Prefetch-Parser
========================
Python script created to parse Windows Prefetch files: Supports XP - Windows 10 Prefetch files

Description
------------
The Windows Prefetch file was put in place to offer performance benefits when launching applications. It just so happens to be one of the more beneficial forensic artifacts regarding evidence of applicaiton execution as well. prefetch.py provides functionality for parsing prefetch files for all current prefetch file versions: 17, 23, 26, and 30.

Features
---------
* Specify a single prefetch file or a directory of prefetch files
* Automatic version detection - no specification required by the user
* On-the-fly type 30 (Windows 10) decompression and parsing
* Sort a directory of Prefetch files by last execution time
* (Mostly) cross-platform: Windows 10 prefetch files must be parsed from a Windows workstation using this script. All others have been tested on both Windows and Linux

**Note: Version 30 (Windows 10):**
The class being utilized for Windows 10 prefetch file decompression makes use of Python's 'ctypes' module. This module relies on the Windows API; the Analyst must be working from a workstation running at least Windows 8 in order to decompress and parse Windows 10 prefetch files.

Command-Line Options
---------------------
For now, prefetch.py requires one of two command-line options: ``--file`` specifies a single prefetch to point the script at. ``--directory`` specifies an entire directory of prefetch files which will be parsed and printed to stdout. When using ``--directory / -d``, remember to include the trailing slash:

::

    dev@computer:~/$ python prefetch.py -h
    usage: prefetch.py [-h] [-f FILE] [-d DIRECTORY]
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -f FILE, --file FILE  Parse a given Prefetch file
      -d DIRECTORY, --directory DIRECTORY
                            Parse a directory of Prefetch files
      -e EXECUTED, --executed EXECUTED
                            Sort a directory of Prefetch files by last execution time
      -z ZERO, --zero ZERO  Identify empty prefetch files

**--file**

Using the ``--file / -f`` switch provides the output below:

::

    dev@computer:~$ python prefetch.py -f PING.EXE-7E94E73E.pf

**--directory**

By invoking the ``--directory / -d`` flag, the Analyst is able to parse an entire directory of Prefetch files at once.

**--executed**

Sort a directory of Prefetch files by last execution time. The output looks like this:

::

    dev@computer:~$ python prefetch.py -e Prefetch/

    2015-10-22 18:11:34.918518 - CONHOST.EXE

    ...

    ...

**--zero**

Recently I encountered multiple zero-byte Prefetch files during an investigation. This broke some of the functionality in my script, which was expecting data instead of null values. I modified the script not to break when it encounters empty Prefetch files. Additionally, I added the ``-z/--zero`` flag which will help an Analyst identify them up front. This piece of the script was cobbled together rather quickly in order to fix my Master copy - I am working on adding a bit of finesse in the "Zero-byte-detection-refinement" branch.

Here is its output, for now:

::

    dev@computer:~$ python prefetch.py -z Prefetch/
    
    ==========================
    Zero-byte Prefetch Files
    ==========================

    WERMGR.EXE-0F2AC88C.pf
    WMIPRVSE.EXE-1628051C.pf

Testing
--------

Testing on the prefetch file types below has been completed successfully:

* Windows XP (version 17)
* Windows 7 (version 23)
* Windows 8.1 (version 26)
* Windows 10 (version 30)

References
-----------
This project would not have been possible without the work of others much smarter than I. The prefetch file format is not officially documented by Microsoft and has been understood through reverse engineering, and trial-and-error. 

Additionally, Without the excellent work by Francesco Picasso in understanding the Windows 10 prefetch compression method, I would not have been able to get Windows 10 parsed here. I use a modified version of his decompression script in prefetch.py. Francesco's original script can be found at the link below:

`w10pfdecomp.py <https://github.com/dfirfpi/hotoloti/blob/master/sas/w10pfdecomp.py>`_
