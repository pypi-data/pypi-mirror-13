pandoc-tablenos
=============

*pandoc-tablenos* is a [pandoc] filter for numbering tables and table references.

Demonstration: Using [`demo.md`] as input gives output files in [pdf], [tex], [html], [epub], [md] and other formats.

This version of pandoc-tablenos was tested using pandoc 1.15.2 and 1.16 (the development version) and is known to work under linux, Mac OS X and Windows.

Rationale
---------

Table numbers and references are required for academic writing, but are not currently supported by pandoc.  It is anticipated that this will eventually change.  Pandoc-tablenos is a transitional package for those who need table numbers and references now.

The syntax for table numbers and references was worked out in [pandoc issue #813].  It seems likely that this will be close to what pandoc ultimately adopts.

By doing one thing -- and one thing only -- my hope is that pandoc-tablenos will permit a relatively painless switch when pandoc provides native support for table numbers and references.

Installation of the filter is straight-forward, with minimal dependencies.  It is simple to use and has been tested extensively.

Markdown Syntax
---------------

To tag a table caption with the label `tbl:description`, use

    Table: Caption. {#tbl:description}

The prefix `#tbl:` is required whereas `description` can be replaced with any combination of letters, numbers, dashes, slashes and underscores.

To reference the table, use

    @tbl:description

or

    {@tbl:description}

Curly braces around a reference are stripped from the output.


Usage
-----

To apply the filter, use the following option with pandoc:

    --filter pandoc-tablenos

Note that any use of the `--filter pandoc-citeproc` or `--bibliography=FILE` options with pandoc should come *after* the pandoc-tablenos filter call.


Details
-------

For tex/pdf output, LaTeX's native `\label` and `\ref` macros are used; for all others the numbers are hard-coded.

Links are constructed for html and pdf output.


Installation
------------

Pandoc-tablenos requires [python], a programming language that comes pre-installed on linux and Mac OS X, and which is easily installed [on Windows].  Either python 2.7 or 3.x will do.

Install pandoc-tablenos as root using the shell command

    pip install pandoc-tablenos 

To upgrade to the most recent release, use

    pip install --upgrade pandoc-tablenos 

Pip is a script that downloads and installs modules from the Python Package Index, [PyPI].  It should come installed with your python distribution.


### Installing on Linux ###

If you are running linux, pip may be bundled separately.  For example, on a Debian-based system (including Ubuntu), you can install it as root using

    apt-get update
    apt-get install python-pip

During the install you may be asked to run

    easy_install -U setuptools

owing to the ancient version of setuptools that Debian provides.  The command should be executed as root.  The pip install process detailed above should now work.
