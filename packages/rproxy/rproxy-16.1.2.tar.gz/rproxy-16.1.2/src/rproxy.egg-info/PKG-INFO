Description: rproxy
        ======
        
        A super simple HTTP/1.1 proxy, with TLS support.
        
        Install from PyPI:
        
        .. code::
        
            $ pip install rproxy
        
        Make a ``rproxy.ini``:
        
        .. code::
        
            [rproxy]
            certs=certificates
            http_ports=80
            https_ports=443
        
            [hosts]
            mysite.com_port=8080
        
        Then run it:
        
        .. code::
        
           sudo twistd -u nobody -g nobody -n rproxy
        
        
        This will start the server, drop permissions (setting the effective uid/guid to nobody), and will proxy incoming requests to ``mysite.com`` to ``localhost:8080``.
        You can configure it further:
        
        .. code::
        
            [rproxy]
            certs=certificates
            letsencrypt=le
            http_ports=80,8080
            https_ports=443
            clacks=true
        
            [hosts]
            mysite.com_port=8080
            mysite.com_host=otherserver
            mysite.com_onlysecure=True
            mysite.com_proxysecure=True
        
            myothersite.net_port=8081
        
        
        This config will:
        
        - connect to ``https://otherserver:8080`` as the proxied server for ``mysite.com``, and only allow HTTPS connections to the proxy for this site
        - connect to ``http://localhost:8081`` as the proxied server for ``myothersite.net``, and allow HTTP or HTTPS connections.
        
        
        General Config
        --------------
        
        - ``http_ports`` -- comma-separated list of numerical ports to listen on for HTTP connections.
        - ``https_ports`` -- comma-separated list of numerical ports to listen on for HTTPS connections.
        - ``certificates`` -- directory where certificates are kept. rproxy looks for ``<host>.pem`` in this folder when serving HTTPS sites.
        - ``letsencrypt`` -- directory where Let's Encrypt ACME challenges are kept -- the "webroot" parameter for https://github.com/kuba/simp_le . rproxy looks for ``<host>/.well-known/acme-challenge`` in this folder when serving Let's Encrypt HTTP-01 challenges.
        - ``clacks`` -- Enable ``X-Clacks-Overhead`` for requests.
        
        
        Hosts Config
        ------------
        
        - ``<host>_onlysecure`` -- enforce HTTPS connections. If not set, or set to False, it will allow HTTP and HTTPS connections.
        - ``<host>_proxysecure`` -- connect to the proxied server by HTTPS. If not set, or set to False, it will connect over HTTP.
        - ``<host>_port`` -- The port of the proxied server that this proxy should connect to.
        - ``<host>_host`` -- the hostname/IP of the server to proxy to.
