Wagtail Error Pages
===================
Pretty and smart default error pages that you can override and customize. It was inspired by A List Apart's article on [The Perfect 404](http://alistapart.com/article/perfect404).

They are intentionally minimalistic and don't include the standard navigation because this is not likely something useful to the lost user; it is a distraction. The ability to return home and the search box are the most important features, as they will bail the user out. If you can include a sitemap at the bottom it is ideal. Use the "Page footer" template block to achieve this (see 404 template reference below).

The 404 page will also adjust the message depending on how the user got there. It does this by checking `document.referrer` in JavaScript. If JavaScript is turned off, it will display a generic message.

Here are the possible messages for **empty referrer**, **external referrer**, **external referrer (search engine)**, and **internal referrer** respectively.

Install
-------

    pip install wagtailerrorpages

Then add `wagtailerrorpages` to your installed apps.

Usage
-----
If you don't have a `404.html` or `500.html` in the root of your templates directory, they will be pulled automatically from this app.

#### 404 Page
To override and style the 404 page, create a `404.html` in the root of your templates directory, and add the following code to the top:

    {% extends "wagtailerrorpages/404base.html" %}

Then, add template blocks to override features of this template. See the section below for a full reference, or refer to `404base.html` inside of this repo.

#### 500 page
You can't configure the 500 page. This is by design; if there is a server error, it's possible that Wagtail will not be capable of rendering template tags, so it's best to keep this template self-contained and static.

If you'd like to make a custom one, copy the one from this app into `templates/500.html` on your app and edit it directly.

#### Testing
If you used [cookiecutter-wagtail](https://github.com/torchbox/cookiecutter-wagtail), you can visit `/test404` and `/test500` on your site in debug mode to preview the templates. If not, you can [configure your urls.py](https://github.com/torchbox/cookiecutter-wagtail/blob/23d5dd7a7ba1e442f6c8c5526d211900d05030ef/%7B%7Bcookiecutter.repo_name%7D%7D/%7B%7Bcookiecutter.repo_name%7D%7D/urls.py#L23) to allow this.

404 Page Template Blocks
------------------------
Use these features to override certain aspects of the 404 template.

#### Document title
Override the page title in the browser tab. It's a good idea to add the website's name at the end.

    {% block title %}Page not found - MySite{% endblock %}

#### HTML meta tags
Override meta tags in the HTML head. Below is the default.

    {% block meta %}
      <meta charset="utf-8">
      <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    {% endblock %}

#### Stylesheet and extra HTML head
Extra head content; put your custom stylesheet here. By default it contains the custom stylesheet, so overriding this block will remove it.

    {% block head %}
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static "css/404.css" %}">
    {% endblock %}

#### Page header
The top part of the page body. By default this contains the "Go home" link. You may want to include the website's logo, but avoid including a full navigation.

    {% block header %}
      [<a href="/">Go home</a>]
    {% endblock %}

#### Page content
It's advised that you don't override this without a good reason. It imports the 404 message fragment.

    {% block content %}
      {% include "wagtailerrorpages/fragments/404message.html" %}
    {% endblock %}

#### Page footer
The bottom part of the page body. You may want to include useful links for a lost user, or legal/copyright information.

    {% block footer %}{% endblock %}
