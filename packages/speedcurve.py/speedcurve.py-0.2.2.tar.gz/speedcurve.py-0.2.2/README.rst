   urls = sc.urls()

   # Get trends and chrome tests for a URL
   urls = sc.url(browser='14419')

   # Get a test

   # Get all the notes for the main site
   notes = sc.notes()

   # Add a note. Timestamp defaults to now()
   note = sc.create_note(
       note="Cleared CDN Cache",
       detail="Testing origin response times"
   )

   # Get latest deployment
   latest_deployment = sc.get_latest_deployment()

   # Get a deployment specified by id
   deployment = sc.get_deployment(id=16627)

   # Add a deployment to default Site for API key
   sc.add_deployment(
       note="Code deployment",
       detail="Triggered a deployment to test session capability"
