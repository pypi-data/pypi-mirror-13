A typical VPC has subnets that are organized with decreasing privacy.

   decreasing

        ^
        |   subnet1: public
        |   subnet2: dmz
        |   subnet3: private

Each subnet has an unique identifier (e.g. subnet1), and a user-friendly name (e.g. dmz, friendly-ness arguable).

In this scheme, the private subnet would typically have a DirectConnect route or VPN connection to the corporate domain. Resources in the public subnet are accessible directly from the public internet. 

Thus, the full set of subnet layers and external connections might look like:

external users <---->  subnet1: public
                   --> subnet2: dmz
                   |    		
                   |
corp domain <--------> subnet3: private

Privacy is created via "one-hop" routing rules between the subnets. Resources in a given subnet can only address other resources one subnet (or one subnet "hop") away.

Thus, an ELB in the public subnet can address an EC2 instance in the dmz, but not an EC2 instance in the private subnet.

By default, YAC resources are sited as privately as possibly, while obeying one-hop rules.

Need external access? Then resources should be sited as follows:

[external-elb]  -> subnet1: public
[asg/ec2]       -> subnet2: dmz
[internal-elb]  -> subnet3: private
[rds]           -> subnet3: private
[efs]           -> subnet3: private

Don't need external access? Then resources should be moved lower to more private subnets as follows:
[external-elb]  -> n/a
[asg/ec2]       -> subnet3: private
[internal-elb]  -> subnet3: private
[rds]           -> subnet3: private
[efs]           -> subnet3: private

If you don't have a DirectConnect route or VPN, your VPC may only have/need two subnet layers.

Here, the full network stack might look like:

external users <-----> subnet1: public
                       ^		
                       |
corp domain <------------> subnet2: private
