Description: Your Atlassian Cloud
        ====================
        
        There is a lot to love about the Atlassian Cloud versions of your
        favorite Atlassian products, including:
        
        -  fast provisioning
        -  pain-free upgrades,
        -  connect plugins,
        -  all the bene's of sas
        
        But their offering comes with constraints, including
        
        -  no support for directory integration,
        -  no support for type II plugins,
        -  poor performance for large user bases,
        -  attack surfaces that may or may not be properly mitigated,
        -  an SLA that may or may not be sufficient
        
        With Atlassian Cloud (YAC), you can have all the benefits of the cloud
        with none of the constraints (well, almost all. Haven't figured out how
        to run connect plugins yet ...).
        
        With YAC, you can easily deploy Atlassian applications to your AWS VPC
        using cloud formation, Docker and ECS (EC2 Container Service).
        
        With YAC you get:
        
        -  support for a scalable user base via Data Center versions of Jira,
           Confluence, and Stash
        -  easy upgrades via Docker
        -  an attack surface under your control
        -  an SLA under your control
        
        To use YAC, you need:
        
        -  an AWS VPC
        -  an AWS credentials file
        -  an SSL cert for your app
        -  a private/public key pair for your app's EC2 instances
        -  an IAM role for your app's EC2 instances
        -  a means of creating a cname for the ELB(s) in your stack
        
        To further customize your stack, you need to have:
        
        -  some Cloud Formation literacy
        -  some Docker/ECS literacy
        -  A can-do spirit (or willingness to contact me if you get stuck)
        
        Stack Diagrams
        ==============
        
        A typical YAC stack includes either 3 or 2 subnet layers (3 is more
        secure):
        
        !(http://imgh.us/yac\_vpc\_3subnets.svg "YAC Stack - 3 Subnets")
        
        !(http://imgh.us/yac\_vpc\_2subnets.svg "YAC Stack - 2 Subnets")
        
        App Diagrams
        ============
        
        A typical YAC app looks like:
        
        !(http://imgh.us/yac\_app.svg "YAC App")
        
        The default versions of all YAC containers can be found in the Docker
        Hub under the nordstromsets repo. Feel free to override with your
        preferred containers!
        
        Use Cases
        =========
        
        Verify your VPC
        ---------------
        
        YAC uses keyword searches to find VPC ids and subnets for building its
        cloud resources.
        
        Use the following command to verify that yac can find your intended VPC
        subnets.
        
        *yac vpc -h*
        
        Build your Stack
        ----------------
        
        Build a stack for your Atlassian application via AWS cloud formation.
        The stack includes all the AWS resources your application needs,
        including ELBs, EC2 instances in an auto-scaling group, an RDS instance,
        an EFS for shared home directories, and a containerized version of your
        Atlassian app.
        
        *yac stack -h*
        
        For example, to build a jira stack tuned to support 500 users into your
        production vpc, run.
        
        *yac stack jira --users=500*
        
        After the stack is built, EC2 instances in your stack will register with
        ECS and downlooad and run the containers in your app. Simple!
        
        A typical intance boot sequence is:
        
        -  EC2 instance gets created per its auto-scaling group, then
        -  ECS agent gets auto-installed, then
        -  ECS agent "phones home" to ECS with its cluster ID, then
        -  ECS agent downloads and runs cluster-specific containers
        
        Setup a DB
        ----------
        
        Setup the DB and DB user on your RDS instance.
        
        *yac db setup -h*
        
        After the setup is complete, you can navigate to your Atlassian app and
        execute the install wizard.
        
        Restore Files from Backups
        --------------------------
        
        Your app includes a backups container that will backup files and
        directories from your app to an S3 bucket. Files and directories can be
        restored via:
        
        *yac restore -h*
        
        Restore a DB
        ------------
        
        The DB for your app is implemented as an RDS instance. The DB will
        automatically take backups of itself for a configurable number of days.
        Backups can be restored via:
        
        *yac db restore -h*
