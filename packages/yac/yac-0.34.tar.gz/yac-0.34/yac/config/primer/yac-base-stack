Build a stack for your Atlassian application via AWS cloud formation. The stack includes all the AWS resources you application needs, including ELBs, EC2 instances in an auto-scaling group, an RDS instance, an EFS for shared home directories, and of course all the associated security groups.

A standard YAC stack is shown in http://yac_standard_stack.svg

A typical Atlassian app fits nicely onto the standard stack, and you may be able to use it as is.

But maybe the standard stack is close, but ...
* your vpc subnets are arranged differently, or
* you may not need all the standard elements, or
* some of the elements need "tweaking" to work for you, or
* you want your own standard stack template that you can keep in configuration management

Let's explore each of these use cases.

** I Am Standard! ***

If the standard stack fits your eye, and your VPC mapping is good to go, you can pull the trigger and start printing stacks.
