Your Atlassian Cloud (YAC) - Naming

Available comands include:

  yac naming (-h | primer)
  yac naming vpc primer

-h provides api help
primer will display this page or the naming/vpc primer page

The YAC naming configuration file is used to set a number of global variables which:

* establish naming standards for the resources you build via YAC, and 
* configure your VPC subnets, and
* generally bend yac to your will

Variables in the naming standards file govern all yac operations, so its usually most convenient to configure your file via the YAC_NAMING enviornment variable.

Alternatively, most yac commands accept a --naming command line argument.

The *yac naming* command can be used to view example files, including files appropriate to VPCs with 2 vs 3 subnet layers.
