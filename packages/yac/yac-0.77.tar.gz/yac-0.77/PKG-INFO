Description: Your Automated Cloud
        ====================
        
        Your service, running on your AWS VPC, from nothing to ka-ching, in an hour.
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        -  Have access to an AWS VPC?
        -  Want to run a service on your VPC using Docker containers?
        -  Have a spare hour?
        -  Then let's get started!
        
        `Quick Start
        Guide <https://yac-stacks.atlassian.net/wiki/display/YAC/Quick+Start+Guide>`__
        
        What is yac?
        ------------
        
        -  A workflow system that does for services what docker did for
           applications
        -  docker helped make it easy to find, run, define, and share individual
           applications
        -  yac does the same for services
        -  A cli app that lets you easily find, run, define, and share web
           service templates
        -  yac registry works just like the docker registry
        -  services are defined as templates in json
        -  services templates can be browsed, instantiated, registered, and
           cloned via the yac registry
        
        What is a service?
        ------------------
        
        -  An application that provides some useful function
        -  An application that can be implemented using one of more Docker
           containers
