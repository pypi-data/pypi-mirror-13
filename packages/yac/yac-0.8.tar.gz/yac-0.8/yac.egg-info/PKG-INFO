Description: =======================
        yac - portable services
        =======================
        
        A service, running on your VPC, from nothing to ka-ching, in a few minutes.
        
        -  Have access to an AWS VPC?
        -  Want to run a service on your VPC using Docker containers?
        -  Have a few spare minutes?
        
        Quick Start
        -----------
        
        Install the cli:
        
        .. code-block:: sh
        
            $ pip install yac
        
        Find a service:
        
        .. code-block:: sh
        
            $ yac service --find=confluence
        
        Print a service:
        
        .. code-block:: sh
        
            $ yac stack intranet atlassian/confluence:latest
        
        What is yac?
        ------------
        
            *  A workflow system that does for services what docker did for
           applications
                *  docker helped make it easy to find, run, define, and share individual
           applications
                *  yac does the same for services
            *  A cli app that lets you easily find, run, define, and share web
           service templates
                *  yac registry works just like the docker registry
                *  services are defined as templates in json
                *  services templates can be browsed, instantiated, registered, and
           cloned via the yac registry
            *  A happy place for service developers, cloud administrators, and service providers
        
        What is a service?
        ------------------
        
        *  An application that provides some useful function
        *  An application that can be implemented using one of more Docker
           containers
