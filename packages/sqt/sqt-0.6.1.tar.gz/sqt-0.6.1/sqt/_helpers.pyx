	"""
	Compute an optimal global or semiglobal alignment between strings s1 and s2.
	An alignment is optimal if it has maximal score.

	The optimal score is not returned. Instead, the number of errors is computed
	and returned.

	Return ... -> (r1, r2, start1, stop1, start2, stop2, errors)

	TODO

	This is a direct translation of the C code and should be re-written to make
	it more readable. (Use Cython's memoryview for the matrix, avoid pointer-like
	access to p1 and p2.)

	FIXME THE REMAINDER OF THIS DOCSTRING

	Return a tuple (row1, row2, start1, stop1, start2, stop2, errors)
	where row1 and row2 are strings of the same length containing the alignment
	(an INDEL is marked by a null byte ('\\0').

	start1 is the position within row1 at which the part of s1, that is aligned, starts.
	start2 is the position within row1 at which the part of s1, that is aligned, ends.
	The same holds for start2, stop2.

	It is always the case that at least one of start1 and start2 is zero.

	It is always the case that either stop1==len(row1) or stop2==len(row2) or both
	(note that len(row1)==len(row2)). This is a property of semiglobal alignments.

	errors is the number of errors in the alignment.

	For example, globalalign("SISSI", "MISSISSIPPI") returns:

	row1 = [   0,   0,   0, 'S', 'I', 'S', 'S', 'I',   0,   0,   0]
	row2 = [ 'M', 'I', 'S', 'S', 'I', 'S', 'S', 'I', 'P', 'P', 'I']
	start1, stop1 = 0, 5
	start2, stop2 = 3, 8
	errors = 0

	This corresponds to the following alignment:
