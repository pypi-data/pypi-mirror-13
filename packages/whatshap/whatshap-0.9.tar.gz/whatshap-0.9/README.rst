WhatsHap
========

WhatsHap is a software for phasing genomic variants using DNA sequencing
reads, also called *haplotype assembly*. It is especially suitable for long
reads, but works also well with short reads.

If you use WhatsHap, please cite:

The version of WhatsHap you find here is the result of further development
focused on making the software easy and straightforward to use. WhatsHap is now
Open Source software under the MIT license and we welcome contributions.


.. note:: WhatsHap is work in progress! In particular, the documentation is
	incomplete, not all features that we would like to have for an initial
	release are there, and there are probably bugs.

Parallel Version: pWhatsHap
---------------------------
A parallelization of the core dynamic programming algorithm has been described in
