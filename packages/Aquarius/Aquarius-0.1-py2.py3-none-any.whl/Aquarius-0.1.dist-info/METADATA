# README #

This project was created to automatize an important task in water aquariums, control the temperature to provide a stable environment to fish life.

There are some solutions with thermostat and another devices to temperature control/monitor, in pet shops.

### Motivation ###

It's complicated take an aquarium, during all day, if you work/study all the week
So, what is possible to do?
I thought  in create a system to monitor the temperature (okay, already exists!), and a system to video monitor (okay again, already exists). 
Although, I unified these systems, to create a more simple, using open source projects, in the web.

### Features ###

* Temperature monitor, using DS18B20
* Temperature heater
* Video monitor

### The cost $$$ ###

Buy just a thermostat with an embedded heater, cost about 15 U$.

Produce this project will cost about:
* Raspberry Pi 35 U$
* DS18B20 5 U$
* Relay 3 U$
* Aquarium heater 10W 5U$
Total: 48 U$

### What will run? ###
It's very simple:
* [Motion](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion)
* [Python](http://www.python.org)
