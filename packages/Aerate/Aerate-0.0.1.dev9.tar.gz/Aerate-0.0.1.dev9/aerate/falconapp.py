        Now that we have the swagger spec, we need to match each resource
        in the spec to a Resource in our falcon API. The list of resources
        we should be expecting can be defined in two ways:

            1) The list of swagger resources defined in the spec. This list is
            built by bravado_core based on item definitions in the schema.

            2) The list of faclon Resource classes defined in the API. This
            list can be built by parsing the list of operationIds generated by
            bravado_core,
                ASSUMING THE USER HAS CORRECTLY SPECIFIED THE OPERATION_IDs

            The Aerate format for OperationIds takes the form:
                <ResourceName><Collection | Item >_on_<http method>

            For example: PetCollection_on_get, UserItem_on_delete

        If we pass in a falcon Resource class, we can then make sure that all
        the OperationIds defined in the spec are also defined in the class. For
        now, we require that every OperationId defined in the spec is also
        defined in the class. Perhaps someday we can be cool about that.

        In addition, we need to make sure that any OperationIds that are
        associated with paths that contain params (e.g. '/user/{user_id}')
        have associated Resource responders that have the correct arguments.
        Using the example above, a path like '/user/{user_id}' with HTTP_METHOD
        get, would need the following responder:

        class UserItem(Resource):

            def on_get(self, req, resp, user_id)

        To check this conforms, if the swagger spec contains a parameter,
        we use the inspect.getargspec() function to ensure that the parameter
        is in the function.
