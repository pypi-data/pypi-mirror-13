        Introduction
        ============
        
        This package provides an integration layer for Plone for the `Australian
        Access Federation <http://aaf.edu.au>`_ (AAF), a Shibboleth-powered
        authentication federation.  This package builds upon `collective.shibboleth <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.shibboleth>`_.
        
        Features
        ========
        
        * Configures the underlying authentication plugin to load user data from
          the relevant AAF attributes.
        
        Most heavy lifting is now carried out by ``collective.shibboleth`` so this
        package just depends upon that.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Installation with Plone follows the standard practice of modifying your
        Buildout configuration like so, adding this package to your list of eggs::
        
            [instance]
            recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
            ...
            eggs +=
                collective.aaf
        
        Once installed, this package will configure the underlying packages in Plone
        accordingly.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        2.1 (2016-01-21)
        ----------------
        
        - Changed `various` import step to be ZCML configured.
          [davidjb]
        
        
        2.0 (2015-05-20)
        ----------------
        
        - **Backwards incompatibility**: because of the migration of portlet to
          ``collective.shibboleth``, you need to remove the existing
          ``collective.aaf`` portlet before upgrading.
          [davidjb]
        - Refactor into ``collective.shibboleth`` and depend on that package.  This
          package now adds just the AAF specific settings into Plone, extending
          ``collective.shibboleth``.
          [davidjb]

        1.2 (2014-02-19)
