        === QuickStart ===
        
        Install OpenStack Nova client tool:
        
          # yum -y install python-novaclient
        
        Get config file:
        
          1. Login to http://qeos.lab.eng.rdu2.redhat.com/
          2. Navigate to Access & Security -> API Access
          3. Save file from "Download OpenStack RC File" to ~/.5minute/config
        
        Get started:
        
          Show help:
        
            $ ./5minute help
        
          Upload your SSH public key:
        
            $ ./5minute key ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
        
          Show images we can work with:
        
            $ ./5minute images
        
          Boot your machine (consider adding '--name' or '--flavor' to the command):
        
            $ ./5minute boot 5minute-RHEL6.6-x86-64-v2
        
          You will get floating IP assigned and *.usersys.redhat.com hostname. It will
          take 5 - 20 minutes to hostname to work, but you should be able to use IP
          just fine:
        
            $ ssh root@10.8.53.29
        
          When you are done, kill the machine (you can do it via OpenStack webUI,
          but this way we can clean DNS records much quicker):
        
            $ ./5minute delete $USER-5minute-RHEL6.6-x86-64-v2
