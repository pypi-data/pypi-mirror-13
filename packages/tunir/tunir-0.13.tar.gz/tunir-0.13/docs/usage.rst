Usage
=====

Tunir is a mini continuous integration (CI) system which can run a set of commands/tests in a
new cloud VM, or bare metal, or in Vagrant boxes based on the job configurations.

The current version can be used along with cron to run at predefined times. Tunir prints
the output in the terminal, it also saves each command it ran, and the output in a text
file located at '/var/run/tunir/tunir_results.txt'.

Enabling a queue of ports for the VMs
-------------------------------------

We maintain a queue of available ports in the local system, which will be used to create
VM(s). We maintain this queue in Redis. We have a helper script which can enable some
default ports to be used. They are defined in the *createports.py*. In case you are using
a rpm, please check */usr/share/tunir/* directory for the same.::

    $ python createports.py

.. note:: This is very important. Please have the queue with usable ports ready before any
   other step. We use ports 2222 to 2230 as the default ports available in createports.py.

Configuring a new job
----------------------

For each different job, two files are required. For example, *default* job has two files,
**default.json** and **default.txt**.

jobname.json
-------------

This file is the main configuration for the job. Below is the example of one such job.

::

    {
      "name": "jobname",
      "type": "vm",
      "image": "file:///home/vms/Fedora-Cloud-Base-20141203-21.x86_64.qcow2",
      "ram": 2048,
      "user": "fedora",
      "password": "passw0rd"
    }

The possible keys are mentioned below.

name
    The name of the job, which must match the filename.

type
    The type of system in which the tests will run. Possible values are vm, docker, bare.

image
    Path to the cloud image in case of a VM. You can provide docker image there for Docker based tests, or the ip/hostname of the bare metal box.

ram
    The amount of RAM for the VM. Optional for bare or docker types.

user
    The username to connect to.

password
    The password of the given user. Right now for cloud VM(s) it is set to *passw0rd*.

key
    The path to the ssh key, the password value should be an empty string for this.

port
    The port number as string to connect. (Required for bare type system.)

jobname.txt
------------

This text file contains the bash commands to run in the system, one command per line. In case you are
rebooting the system, you may want to use **SLEEP NUMBER_OF_SECONDS** command there.

If a command starts with @@ sign, it means the command is supposed to fail. Generally we check the return codes
of the commands to find if it failed, or not. For Docker container based systems, we track the stderr output.

We can also have non-gating tests, means these tests can pass or fail, but the whole job status will depend
on other gating tests. Any command in jobname.txt starting with ## sign will mark the test as non-gating.

Example::

    ## curl -O https://kushal.fedorapeople.org/tunirtests.tar.gziii
    ls /
    ## foobar
    ## ls /root
    ##  sudo ls /root
    date
    @@ sudo reboot
    SLEEP 40
    ls /etc



Example of configuration file to run the tests on a remote machine
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The configuration::

    {
      "name": "remotejob",
      "type": "bare",
      "image": "192.168.1.100",
      "ram": 2048,
      "user": "fedora",
      "key": "/home/password/id_rsa"
      "port": "22"
    }




Start a new job
---------------

::

    $ sudo ./tunir --job jobname



Job configuration directory
----------------------------

You can actually provide a path to tunir so that it can pick up job configuration and commands from the given directory.::

    $ sudo ./tunir --job jobname --config-dir /etc/tunirjobs/


Persistence for downloaded images
---------------------------------

To make images that are downloaded persist across runs of tunir and get reused then you can specify the image directory to save them in.::

    $ sudo ./tunir --job jobname --image-dir /var/lib/tunirimages/


Stateless jobs
---------------

.. note:: Now all jobs are by default stateless.

You can run a job as stateless, which does not require any database. This will print the result at the end of the
run.::

    $ sudo ./tunir --job jobname --stateless


Atomic images
-------------

In case you are using an Atomic image in vm, you can pass the command line argument *--atomic*, that way Tunir will be
able to boot the image properly in the local system.

Timeout issue
--------------

In case if one of the command fails to return within 10 minutes (600 seconds),
tunir will fail the job with a timeout error. It will be marked at the end of
the results. You can change the default value in the config file with a timeout
key. In the below example I am having 300 seconds as timeout for each command.::

     {
      "name": "jobname",
      "type": "vm",
      "image": "file:///home/vms/Fedora-Cloud-Base-20141203-21.x86_64.qcow2",
      "ram": 2048,
      "user": "fedora",
      "password": "passw0rd",
      "timeout": 300

    }
