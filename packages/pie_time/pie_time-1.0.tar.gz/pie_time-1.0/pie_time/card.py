class AbstractCard(object):
    """
    The abstract card class.

    All the custom cards **must** inherit from this class.

    **Application binding and settings.**

    The application calls the card's :py:meth:`pie_time.AbstractCard.set_app`
    and :py:meth:`pie_time.AbstractCard.set_settings` methods during
    initialization (before calling the
    :py:meth:`pie_time.AbstractCard.initialize` method).

    The application reference is stored in ``_app`` attribute.

    The settings dictionary is stored in ``_settings`` attribute and defaults
    to an empty dictionary.

    **Drawing**

    All the drawing on the card's surface should be done in the
    :py:meth:`pie_time.AbstractCard.tick` method. The method's implementation
    should be as fast as possible to avoid throttling the FPS down.

    **Resources**

    The :py:meth:`pie_time.AbstractCard.path_for_resource` method can be used
    to get an absolute path to a resource file. The card's resource folder
    should be placed along with the module containing the card's class.

    Name of the resource folder can be customized by overriding the
    :py:attr:`pie_time.AbstractCard.RESOURCE_FOLDER` attribute.
