PieTime
=======

Desk clock for your Raspberry Pi.

About
-----

PieTime lets you turn your Raspberry Pi into a desk clock. It's written in
Python using PyGame framework.

PieTime comes with three modules that allow displaying the clock, weather and
set of pictures. These modules (also known as *cards*) are highly configurable,
so you can tweak them to better suit your needs.

Additionally, an API is provided for users who wish to write their own cards.
Read on for an example of a card.

* Choose any of the three builtin cards.
* Configure display aspects (e.g. text color) of the cards.
* Define card visibility intervals.
* Set up screen blanking period for power saving.
* Use the card API to create your own cards.
