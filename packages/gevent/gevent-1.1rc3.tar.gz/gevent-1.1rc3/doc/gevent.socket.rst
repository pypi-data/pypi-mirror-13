 :mod:`gevent.socket` -- Cooperative low-level networking interface
====================================================================

This module provides socket operations and some related functions. The
API of the functions and classes matches the API of the corresponding
items in the standard :mod:`socket` module exactly, but the
synchronous functions in this module only block the current greenlet
and let the others run.

.. warning:: gevent's sockets have thread affinity. That is, they can
             only be used from the operating system thread that
             created them (any greenlet in that thread can use the
             socket). The results of attempting to use the socket in
             another thread (for example, passing it to the
             threadpool) are not defined (but one common outcome is a
             ``LoopExit`` exception).

For convenience, exceptions (like :class:`error <socket.error>` and
:class:`timeout <socket.timeout>`) as well as the constants from the
:mod:`socket` module are imported into this module.


The exact API exposed by this module varies depending on what version
of Python you are using. The documents below describe the API for
Python 2 and Python 3, respectively.

.. caution:: All the described APIs should be imported from
   ``gevent.socket``, and *not* from their implementation modules.
   Their organization is an implementation detail that may change at
   any time.

   Python 3 interface <gevent._socket3>
   Python 2 interface <gevent._socket2>

Gevent Extensions
=================

Beyond the basic standard library interface, ``gevent.socket``
provides some extensions. These are identical and shared by all
versions of Python.

Waiting
-------

These functions are used to block the current greenlet until an open
file (socket) is ready to perform I/O operations. These are low-level
functions not commonly used by many programs.

.. note:: These use the underlying libev ``io`` watchers, which means
          that they share the same implementation limits. For example,
          on some platforms they can be used with more than just
          sockets, while on others the applicability is more limited.
