  Struthon 0.4.2
  - StruthonConcretePanel upgraded

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Prerequisites:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Python 2.7.
  Non-standard Python library needed (tested version):
  - StruPy 0.4.1
  - Unum 4.1
  - matplotlib 1.4.2
  - PyQt4 4.11.4

  If you are beginner in Python configuration you can install Python(xy) 
  or WinPython then you only need to install strupy and unum package 
  (using "pip install strupy", and "pip install unum" in console).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
* To install struthon:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

  After the Python and needed library  was installed:
  On Windows use "pip install struthon" in Python shell.

  To run struthon GUI execute the file struthon.py from installed struthon
  package folder - probabiliit is "C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\struthon"
  For easy run make shortcut on your system pulpit to this file.
  For reinstall struthon (if new version available) all you need to do is
  "pip install --upgrade struthon".
  The same do with strupy package if new version available. The created
  shortcut should be still working.

  I did not tested the application on Linux yet. There may by some problems
  on Linux with launching aplication from struthon main panel (struthon.py). 
  You should run directly ConcreteMonoSection.py, SteelMonoSection.py, 
  SteelSectionBrowser.py etc.
