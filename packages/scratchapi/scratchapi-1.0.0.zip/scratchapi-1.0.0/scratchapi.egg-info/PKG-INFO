        ==========
        To use the api, you must log in to your scratch account:

          import scratchapi
          scratch = scratchapi.ScratchUserSession('Username', 'password')
        
        Now, you can verify your session to see if you logged in correctly:
        ::
          scratch.tools.verify_session()

        Follow Someone:
