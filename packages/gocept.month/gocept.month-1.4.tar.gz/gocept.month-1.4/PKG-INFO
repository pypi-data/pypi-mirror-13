        This package provides the data type ``Month`` (typical usage:
        ``Month(4, 2003)``), which supports conversion to and from strings, as well as
        a zope.schema field and widgets for both zope.formlib and z3c.form.
        
        To use the month field, ``<include package="gocept.month"/>`` and declare a
        schema like this:
        
            >>> import gocept.month
            >>> import zope.interface
            >>> import zope.schema
            >>> class IContract(zope.interface.Interface):
            ...     title = zope.schema.TextLine(title=u"Contract title")
            ...     start = gocept.month.MonthField(title=u"Starting date")
            ...     end = gocept.month.MonthField(title=u"Ending date")
        
        To use the form widgets, you need to require the ``form`` setuptools extra
        (i.e. ``gocept.month[form]``), and ``<include
        package="gocept.month.browser"/>`` in your ZCML.
        
        
        CHANGES
        =======
        
        1.4 (2016-02-07)
        ----------------
        
        - Add a ``__len__`` method to `MonthInterval`.
        
        - Require `z3c.form >= 2.6` to get rid of some odd test dependencies.
        
        
        1.3.2 (2015-10-13)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix `configure.zcml` to include needed `meta.zcml` files.
        
        
        1.3.1 (2015-08-05)
        ------------------
        
        - Migrate repository to https://bitbucket.org/gocept/gocept.month
        
        
        1.3 (2014-07-16)
        ----------------
        
        - Add placeholder for month widget in z3c forms describing the required month
          format.
        
        
        1.2 (2013-02-18)
        ----------------
        
        - Split off widgets into setuptools extra ``form``, and don't include the
          ``browser`` ZCML by ourselves, so clients can use only the domain part of
          this package without the UI parts.
        
        - Added ``firstOfMonth`` method to ``Month``.
        
        - Using `zope.formlib >= 4.0` instead of `zope.app.form`.
        
        - Updated to ZTK 1.1.5.
        
        
        1.1 (2012-02-09)
        ----------------
        
        - Add MonthInterval.forYear().
        - Declared ``fromString`` method as a class method in interface.
        
        
        1.0.2 (2011-09-01)
        ------------------

        - Declare dependencies that some upstream packages need but don't declare.
        
        - Use stdlib's doctest module, not zope.testing's which is deprecated.
        
        
        1.0 (2009-10-05)
        ----------------
