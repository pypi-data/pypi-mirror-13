cbeams
======

`cbeams` is a command-line program which draws pretty animated colored circles
in the terminal.

Dependencies
------------

Developed on on Ubuntu 14.04.

Likely runs on other Linux.

Might work on OSX.

Will not work on Windows. The 'cmd' terminal does not accept ANSI terminal
codes. Could probably be made to work on Windows using 'colorama', or ansi.sys.

Requires Python 3.4. Probably also runs on other 3.x, but I haven't tried it.

Python dependencies are specified in setup.py.

Install
-------

::

    pip install cbeams

Usage
-----

See `cbeams -h`.

Immediate Future Plans
----------------------
* Upload to PyPI
    Using setup.cfg instead of setup.py?
* Create a wheel
    Using 'twine'? See https://packaging.python.org
    Backport this into python-app template
* Create a redistributable binary for Linux
    Backport this into python-app template
* Switch to python3.5.1
* Create a redistributable binary for OSX
    Backport this into python-app template
* Run on Windows, using colorama
* Create a redistributable binary for Windows

Hacking
-------

To populate a virtualenv, run tests, etc, see the commands in the Makefile.
These can often work in Windows too, under Bash shells like Cygwin, Msys.

Populating the virtualenv in the manner shown in the Makefile will also
add "-e ." to the virtualenv, which adds this project in 'develop mode',
meaning both that source edits are immediately visible within the virtualenv,
and that the application entry points listed in setup.py are converted into
executable scripts on the PATH.

Thanks

To the processes or influences that resulted in the creation of our universe
and the emergence within it of complexity, life, and intelligence.
