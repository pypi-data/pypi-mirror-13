Tutorial
========

This section will present the essential features of :mod:`pybinding` with example code to get you
started quickly. The tutorial assumes basic understanding of the `Python 3 programming language
<https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/>`_ and at least part of the `scientific Python stack (SciPy)
<http://www.scipy.org/docs.html>`_: :mod:`numpy` and :mod:`matplotlib` are used regularly in the
example code. But don't worry: while this tutorial will not specifically explain basic language
and scientific Python concepts, they are presented in a straightforward way and will be easy to
pick up on the fly.
