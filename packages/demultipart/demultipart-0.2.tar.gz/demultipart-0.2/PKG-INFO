Description: .. contents::
        
        Unpack a MIME message into a directory of files.
        
        Overview
        ========
        
        MIME messages can be useful as cheap archives: unlike zipfile/tarfile standard
        modules, email.mime.multipart does not require a full-functional file to
        create an archive. MIME messages lack the ability to seek to a given file
        efficiently (much like tar), they have no standard compression (but it can be
        handled independently anyway), and lack a standard tool to extract them.
        
        Inspired from python's `email examples`_ .
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Extract to directory `$PWD/some` ::
        
          $ demultipart /path/to/some.multipart
        
        Any number of multipart files can be specified, they will be extracted in
        provided order in their own directories.
        
        Tries to prevent escaping extraction directory, but not tested on Windows.
        
        Skips input file if extraction directory already exists.
        
        TODO
        ====
        
        - Provide compatibility with standard CLI archive manipulation tools (tar,
          unzip...) so GUI can wrap this command too.
        
        - Maybe add multipart creation support.
