HACKING
-------

Please add tests for any new functionality.

Run the tests with ``make test``. If you don't want to do it that way (perhaps you don't
have make or zero-install), it's basically ``nosetests --with-doctest --exe``, once you've
made sure your local version of ``piep`` is on ``$PYTHONPATH``.
