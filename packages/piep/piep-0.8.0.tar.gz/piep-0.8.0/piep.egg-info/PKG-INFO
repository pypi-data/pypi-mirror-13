        HACKING
        -------
        
        Please add tests for any new functionality.
        
        Run the tests with ``make test``. If you don't want to do it that way (perhaps you don't
        have make or zero-install), it's basically ``nosetests --with-doctest --exe``, once you've
        made sure your local version of ``piep`` is on ``$PYTHONPATH``.
