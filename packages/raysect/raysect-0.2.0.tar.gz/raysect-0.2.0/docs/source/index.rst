Welcome to Raysect, an OOP ray-tracing framework in python. Raysect has been
built with scientific ray-tracing in mind. Some of its features include:

* Fully spectral, high precision. Supports scientific ray-tracing of spectra from physical light sources such as plasmas.
* All core loops are written in cython for speed.
* Easily extensible, written with user customisation of materials and emissive sources in mind.
* Different observer types supported such as Pinhole cameras and optical fibres.
