Description: py-dom-xpath is a pure Python implementation of XPath 1.0. It
        supports almost all XPath 1.0, with the main exception being the
        namespace axis. It operates on DOM 2.0 nodes, and works well with
        xml.dom.minidom.
        
        py-dom-xpath requires Python 2.5 or greater.
