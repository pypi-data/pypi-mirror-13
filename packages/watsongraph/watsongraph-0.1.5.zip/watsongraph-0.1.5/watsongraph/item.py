# Every augmentation is the ConceptModel of a new user-indicated Item of interest. I have to come up with some sort
# of mathematically justified way of merging this new Item into the old model: decaying the old nodes and reinforcing
# the overlap.
# Idea: every iteration the existing non-overlapping nodes lose 1/10 of their current relevance. Newly added nodes
# come in at high relevance (.9?). Overlapping elements gain half of the distance between their sum and 1.

# TODO: compare() method for measuring the overlap between two items.
