    # 2. In `conceptmodel` create a `set_property(concept, property, value)` method for writing to it.
    # 3. In `conceptmodel` create a `give_property(map)` method for writing to it via a function.
    # 4. Rewrite the `conceptmodel` methods which set relevance directly to do so via `set_relevance()`.
    # 5. Re-frame `view_count` and `relevance` as two use-cases of `props` which are supported by default.
    #    e.g. rewrite `set_view_count()` and `set_relevance()`.
    # 6. Rewrite `conceptmodel` `to_json()` and `from_json()` methods to pass `props` materials around.
