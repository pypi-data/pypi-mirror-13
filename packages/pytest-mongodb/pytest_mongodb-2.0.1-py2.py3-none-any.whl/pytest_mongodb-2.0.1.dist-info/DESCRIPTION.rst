What is this?
=============

This is a pytest plugin, that enables you to test your code that relies on a
database connection to a MongoDB and expectes certain data to be present.
It allows you to specify fixtures for database collections in JSON/BSON or YAML
format. Under the hood we use the mongomock_ library, that you should
consult for documentation on how to use MongoDB mock objects. If suitable you
can also use a real MongoDb server.

*Note*: This project has been renamed from `humongous` to `pytest-mongodb` in order
to conform to the pytest plugin naming conventions and to be more easy to find.


Configuration
-------------

If you don't want to put your fixtures on the top-level directory of your package
you have to specify a directory where `pytest-mongodb` looks for your data definitions.

To do so put a line like the following under the ``pytest`` section of your
`pytest.ini`-file put a

.. code-block:: ini

    [pytest]
    mongodb_fixture_dir =
      tests/unit/fixtures

`pytest-mongodb` would then look for files ending in ``.yaml`` or ``.json`` in that
directory.

You can also choose to use a real MongoDB server for your tests. In that case
you might also want to configure the hostname and/or the credentials if you
don't want to stick with the default (localhost and no credentials). Use the
following configuration values in your `pytest.ini` to adapt the settings to
your needs:

.. code-block:: ini

    [pytest]
    mongodb_engine = pymongo
    mongodb_host = mongodb://user:passwd@server.tld
    mongodb_dbname = mydbname


Basic usage
-----------

After you configured `pytest-mongodb` so that it can find your fixtures you're ready to
specify some data. Regardless of the markup language you choose, the data is provided
as a list of documents (dicts). The collection that these documents are being inserted
into is given by the filename of your fixutre-file. E.g.: If you had a file named
``players.yaml`` with the following content:

.. code-block:: yaml

    -
      name: Mario
      surname: GÃ¶tze
      position: striker

    -
      name: Manuel
      surname: Neuer
      position: keeper


you'd end up with a collection `players` that has the above player definitions
inserted. If your fixture file is in JSON/BSON format you can also use BSON specific
types like `$oid`, `$date`, etc.


You get ahold of the database in you test-function by using the ``humongous`` fixture
like so:

.. code-block:: python

    def test_players(mongodb):
        assert 'players' in mongodb.collection_names()
        manuel = mongodb.players.find_one({'name': 'Manuel'})
        assert manuel['surname'] == 'Neuer'
