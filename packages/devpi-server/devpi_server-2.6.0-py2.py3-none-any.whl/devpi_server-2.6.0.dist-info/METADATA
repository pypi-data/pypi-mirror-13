devpi-server: consistent pypi.python.org cache, github-style internal indexes

consistent robust pypi-cache
----------------------------------------

You can point ``pip or easy_install`` to the ``root/pypi/+simple/``
index, serving as a self-updating transparent cache for pypi-hosted
**and** external packages.  Cache-invalidation uses the latest and
greatest PyPI protocols.  The cache index continues to serve when
offline and will resume cache-updates once network is available.

github-style indexes
---------------------------------

Each user can have multiple indexes and upload packages and docs via
standard ``setup.py`` invocations.  Users, indexes (and soon projects
and releases) are manipulaed through a RESTful HTTP API.

index inheritance
--------------------------

Each index can be configured to merge in other indexes so that it serves
both its uploads and all releases from other index(es).  For example, an
index using ``root/pypi`` as a parent is a good place to test out a
release candidate before you push it to PyPI.

good defaults and easy deployment
---------------------------------------

Get started easily and create a permanent devpi-server deployment
including pre-configured templates for ``nginx`` and cron. 

separate tool for Packaging/Testing activities
-------------------------------------------------------

The complimentary `devpi-client <http://pypi.python.org/devpi-client>`_ tool
helps to manage users, indexes, logins and typical setup.py-based upload and
installation workflows.

See http://doc.devpi.net for getting started and documentation.



Changelog
=========

2.6.0 (2016-1-29)
-----------------

- fix issue262: new experimental option --offline-mode will prevent
  devpi-server from even trying to perform network requests and it
  also strip all non-local release files from the simple index.
  Thanks Daniel Panteleit for the PR.

- fix issue304: mark devpi-server versions older than 2.2.x as incompatible
  and requiring an import/export cycle.

- fix issue296: try to fetch files from master again when requested, if there
  were checksum errors during replication.

- if a user can't be found during authentication (with ``setup.py upload`` for
  example), then the http return code is now 401 instead of 404.

- fix issue293: push from root/pypi to another index is now supported

- fix issue265: ignore HTTP(S) proxies when checking if the server is
                already running.

- Add ``content_type`` route predicate for use by plugins.



2.5.3 (2015-11-23)
------------------

- fix a bug that resulted from accessing a non-existing project on 
  root/pypi where upstream does not contain the X-PYPI-LAST-SERIAL
  header usually.  Thanks Matthias Bach.


2.5.2 (2015-11-20)
------------------

- recognize "pex" for redirections of user/index/NAME to
  user/index/+simple/NAME just like we do with pip/setuptools.

- fix py2 incompatibility introduced with 2.5.1 where we used
  a unicode header and pyramid only likes str-headers.


2.5.1 (2015-11-20)
------------------

- fix issue289: fix simple page serving on replicas


2.5.0 (2015-11-19)
------------------

- fix a regression of 2.3.0 which would cause many write-transactions
  for mirrored simple-page entries that didn't change.  Previous to the fix,
  accesses to mirrored simple pages will result in a new
  write-transaction every 30 minutes if the page is accessed which
  is likely on a somewhat busy site.  If you running with replicas
  it is recommended to do an an export/import cycle to remove all 
  the unneccessary writes that were produced since devpi-server-2.3.0.
  They delay the setup of new replicas considerably.

- add info about pypi_whitelist on simple page when root/pypi is blocked for
  a project.

- replica simple-page serving will not unneccessarily wait for new 
  simple-page entries to arrive at the replication side if the master 
  does not return any changes in the initial simple-page request.
  Previously a replica would wait for the replication-thread to catch
  up even if no links changed.

- fix setup.py to work on py34 and with LANG="C" environments.
  Thanks Jason R. Coombs.

- fix issue284: allow users who are listed in acl_upload to delete packages
