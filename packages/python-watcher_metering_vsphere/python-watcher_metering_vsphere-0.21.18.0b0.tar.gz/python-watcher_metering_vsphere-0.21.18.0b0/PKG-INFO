Description: ========================
        Watcher Metering vSphere
        ========================
        
        Introduction
        ============
        
        Watcher Metering vSphere provides a set of metric-pulling drivers extending the
        `Watcher Metering`_ project which is used to collect system metrics from a
        `vSphere datacenter`_ before publishing them to a given store.
        
        To sum up, Watcher Metering service is composed by 2 modules:
        
        - The ``Agent`` who collects the desired metrics and sends it to a publisher.
        - The ``Publisher`` who gathers measurements from one or more agent and pushes
          them to the desired store.
        
        Drivers easily extend metrics collecting features of Agent (we use `stevedore`_ library for managing plugins).
        
        This project is part of the Watcher_ project.

        Getting started
        ===============
        
        System requirements
        -------------------
        
        Watcher Metering packages must be installed before installing the drivers.
        Please follow the installation procedure of the `Watcher Metering`_ project first.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install this package, just use *pip*:
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
            # pip install python-watcher_metering_vsphere
        
        
        Activate a driver
        -----------------
        
        Within your Watcher Metering Agent configuration file ``/etc/watcher-metering/watcher-metering-agent.conf``,
        add the name of the driver entry point, in the ``[agent]`` section,  you wish to enable.
        
        As an example, if you wish to acticate both the ``vsphere_mem_usage`` and the
        ``vsphere_cpu_usage`` drivers, just edit the aforementioned configuration file like
        this:
        
        .. code-block:: ini
        
             [agent]
             driver_names =
                vsphere_mem_usage,
                vsphere_cpu_usage
        
        After updating the configuration file, you have to `restart the Watcher Metering Agent`_.
        
        .. _restart the Watcher Metering Agent: https://github.com/b-com/watcher-metering/blob/master/doc/source/deploy/installation.rst#command
        
        Driver configuration
        ====================
        
        To find out about the available drivers, please refer to the `vSphere drivers configuration`_ page
        
        Each driver can be also configurable by adding a dedicated section named
        ``[metrics_driver.driver_name]`` in a configuration file loaded by the Watcher
        Metering Agent. Such a file is self documented, so you will find in it all
        driver configuration documentation.
        
        You will find a sample by editing the file `etc/watcher-metering-vsphere/watcher-metering-vsphere.conf.sample`_
