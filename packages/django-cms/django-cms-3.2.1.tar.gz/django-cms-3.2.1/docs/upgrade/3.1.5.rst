Bug Fixes
=========

- Fixed a tree corruption when pasting a nested plugin under another plugin.


Treebeard corruption
====================

Prior to 3.1.5 moving or pasting nested plugins would lead to some non-fatal tree corruptions,
raising an error when adding plugins under the newly pasted plugins.

To fix these problems, upgrade to 3.1.5 and then run ``manage.py cms fix-tree`` command to
repair the tree.


DjangoCMS Text CKEditor
=======================

Action required
---------------
CMS 3.1.5 is not compatible with djangocms-text-ckeditor < 2.7.1.
If you're using djangocms-text-ckeditor, please upgrade to 2.7.1 or up.
Keep in mind that djangocms-text-ckeditor >= 2.8 is compatible only with
CMS 3.2.x releases.
