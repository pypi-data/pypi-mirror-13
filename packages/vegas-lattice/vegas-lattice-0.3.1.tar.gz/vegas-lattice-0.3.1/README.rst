vegas-lattice
=============

A lattice generator part of the **vegas** software initiative,
it provides the esential routines to generate regular graph lattices
in linear time, as well as some cuts of those lattices for nano particles
and randomly depleted lattices.

Instalation
-----------

The **vegas-lattice** program has been tested in python 2.7, 3.4 and 3.5
to work properly, you can install the package from the python package index
using the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install vegas-lattice   # this might require sudo

After that the `vegas-lattice` command should be available to your
command prompt.

Feel free to use the descriptor files provided in the **docs** directory
to do some tests, and also to run

.. code-block:: bash

    vegas-lattice --help

to get some instructions in how to use the program.
