        ## Install dependencies
        I suggest creating a virtualenv.
        
            $ make deps
        
        ## Try the demo:
        
            $ make prepare-example
        
        Open two extra terminal windows and from one run:
        
            $ ./example/respond.py
            
        from the other run:
        
            $ ./example/sub_only.py 
            
        Then from the first window run:
        
            ./example/nats_demo.py
