- This is a modified version of Paul's and Nicojo's answers on stackoverflow.
- Reference: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1557571/how-to-get-time-of-a-python-program-execution

**Usage Case:**

>>> # At the beginning of the chunk of code to be timed.
>>> import timing
>>> # Once the program finish execution it will print
>>> # temporal metadata in this form.
