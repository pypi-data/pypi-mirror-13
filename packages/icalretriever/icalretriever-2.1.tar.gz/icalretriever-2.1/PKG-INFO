Description: ICalRetriever
        =============
        
        |build status|
        
        ICalRetriever is a HTTP ICS retriever. It is designed to be called by a
        crontab each hour in order to download an ICalendar file from a designed
        HTTP location, eventually apply filters on it, and then write it to the
        disk.
        
        Then, you can serve the ICal to WebDAV clients (using Radicale WebDAV
        server for example) in readonly mode, so that their synchronised ICal
        file is updated each hour conforming to the ICS HTTP source.
        
        Installing
        ----------
        
        ICalRetriever is available on PyPI as ``icalretriever``.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Simply call the retriever with the configuration file as parameter.

        Configuration file
        ------------------

            calendars:
             - name: Fake calendar (filtered)
               file: output_filtered.ics
               url: http://perdu.com/fake.ics
               filters:
                 - name: remove_days
                   args: [5, 6]
                 - name: remove_name
                   args: ["Boring event I dont want", "Another boring event"]
        
             - name: Fake calendar (not filtered)
               file: output.ics
