## Install
```
pip install python-semantic-release
```

## Usage
The general idea is to have some sort of tag in commit messages that indicates certain types of changes.
If a commit message lack a tag it is ignored. Running release can be run locally or from a CI service.

```
Usage: semantic-release [OPTIONS] COMMAND

Options:
  --major  Force major version.
  --minor  Force minor version.
  --patch  Force patch version.
  --noop   No-operations mode, finds the new version number without changing it.
  --post   If used with the changelog command, the changelog will be posted to the release api.
  --help   Show this message and exit.
```

### Commands

* `version` - Create a new release. Will change the version, commit it and tag it.
* `publish` - Runs version before pushing to git and uploading to pypi.
* `changelog` - Generates the changelog for the next release.

### Running commands from setup.py
Add the following to your setup.py and you will be able to run `python setup.py <command>`
as you would `semantic-release <command>`.

```python
try:
    from semantic_release import setup_hook
    setup_hook(sys.argv)
except ImportError:
    pass
```

### Configuration
