- Renamed view ``authomatic-login`` to ``authomatic-handler``, because this
  view will be used to add an identity too (url must be registered on provider
  side sometimes and we want to do this only once).

- Minimal validation of JSON.

  expected return urls .

- Allow multiple services for one user. This changes a lot behind the scenes.
