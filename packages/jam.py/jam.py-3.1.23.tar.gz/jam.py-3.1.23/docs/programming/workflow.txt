Workflow
========

In the Jam.py framework on the server there are two tasks at the same time: 
Administrator and Project. Each of which represents a tree of objects - there 
are the Administrator task tree and the Project task tree. So prior to 
consideration of the Jam.py workflow it's necessary to be familiar with the 
concept of the :doc:`task tree <task_tree>`.

The the Jam.py workflow is the following:

* After apllication.py is started the Administrator task tree is created and 
  initialized on the server.
* The Project task tree is created on the server by Administrator after the 
  server receives first request from the Project client.
* When client (Administrator or Project) is first run in the browser (after 
  admin.html or index.html is loaded) the empty task object is built that sends 
  to the server a request to initialize itself.
* If the project safe mode parameter is set, the framework checks if the user is 
  logged before executing any request. If not then it notifies the client that 
  it must to login, client creates a login form and after a user inputs its login 
  and password the client task sends server request to login.
* After successfull login or if the project safe mode parameter is not set the 
  server sends the client iformation about the requested task. The task on the 
  client builds its tree, based on this information, assigns event handlers to 
  its objects and executes on_page_loaded event handler. In this event handler 
  a developer should
