  work in the system (See :doc:`Users <users>` and :doc:`Roles <roles>`). 
* **Debugging** - If this button is checked, compressed project javascript and 
  css files are send to the client.
* **Connection pool size** — the size of the server database connection pool. 
* **Multiprocessing connection pool** - if this checkbox is checked the framework 
  creates connection pool by using multiprocessing python module
* **Persistent connection** - if this checkbox is checked and multiprocessing 
  connection pool is selected, the framework creates connection in the main 
  process. Before executing any statement, the framework checks if this 
  connection is busy, if not, the statment is executed by this connection, 
  otherwise multiprocessing connection pool is used.
* **Version** — specify the version of the project here.

values will be displayed in the project:

Database
========

In this dialog project database pararameters are displayed. When they have been 
changed and OK button is clicked, the Administrator will check connection to the 
database and if it failed to connect the error will be displayed.

If **DB manual update** checkbox is unchecked (default), then when changes to an 
item, that have an associated database table, are saved, this database table is 
automatically modified. For example, if we add a new field to some catalog in the 
project, the new field will be create if the database table associated with this
catalog as well. If this checkbox is checked, no modifications to the database 
tables are made. Please be very carefull when changing this option.
