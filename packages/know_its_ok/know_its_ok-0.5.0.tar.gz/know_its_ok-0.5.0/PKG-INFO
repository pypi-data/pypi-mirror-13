Description: ************
        Know It's Ok
        ************
        
        The purpose of Know It's Ok is to make it as easy as possible to run your tests 
        while you're debugging your code.  In particular, it's main features are:
        
        1. It finds your tests from anywhere in your repository.
        2. It runs your tests with arguments tailored towards debugging.
        3. It only requires typing two letters: ``ok``
        
        Installation
        ============
        Know It's Ok is available from PyPI::
        
           $ pip install know_its_ok
        
        It's only dependencies are pytest and pytest-cov, which should both be 
        installed automatically.
        
        Usage
        =====
        You can run Know It's Ok from anywhere in your package's repository::
        
           $ ok
        
        You can also specify individual tests to run (by default they will all be run).  
        You don't need to specify the complete name of a test, any substring of a test 
        will be understood.  For example, if you have a test called ``test_foo.py``, 
        you can use this command to run it::
        
           $ ok foo
        
        You can also specify arguments that should be passed through to ``pytest`` 
        (this won't work if the argument to ``pytest`` also matches the name of one of 
        your tests, but in practice this is never a problem)::
        
           $ ok --pdb
        
        In order to discover your tests simply, Know It's Ok is very opinionated about 
        the organization of your code.  In particular:
        
        1. Your code must be version controlled using ``git``.
        2. Your tests must be stored in a directory called ``tests/``, which itself 
           must be located in the top level of your repository.
        3. Inside the ``tests/`` directory, your tests must match the pattern: 
           ``??_test_*.py``.
        4. Your tests must be written using the ``pytest`` framework.
        5. Your package must be located in a directory containing and ``__init__.py`` 
           file.
        
        If any of these expectations are not met, the code should raise an exception.
