    We want to default to The Simplest Thing That Can Possibly Work. This
    allows new services to hit the ground running, but forces developers to
    think about their resource needs and tune as they move toward production.
    So:

    - .1 cpus
        - This is a good starting place. Most services use a very small
          percentage of a core.
    - 500MB of memory.
        - Docker processes will *not* be sharing virt across containers.
          I'm pretty sure in practice 500M going to be a sane starting point for
          most services. It is ok to start low and let them go high.
    - 3 instances, including 1 canary. Why 2+1 instead of 1+1?
        - Three Of Everything (http://opsprincipl.es/principles/three_of_everything/)
        - If we reboot the dev box running that single main instance, the
          cluster is reduced to just a canary. This also may trigger (useless)
          alerts.
        - krall: In production, there will be multiple main instances and a single
          canary. With 1+1, this is less obvious.
