        Welcome to kploy, an opinionated Kubernetes deployment system for
        appops. We use convention over configuration in order to enable you to
        run microservices-style applications with Kubernetes as simple and fast
        as possible.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        See `kubernetes.sh/kploy <http://kubernetes.sh/kploy/>`__ for

        Roadmap

        planned features.
