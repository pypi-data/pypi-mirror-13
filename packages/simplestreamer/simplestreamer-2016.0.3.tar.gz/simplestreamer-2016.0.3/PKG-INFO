Description: # simplestreamer
        
        This is a tiny (< 150 loc) peer-to-peer data-streaming library designed for high-frequency status data.
        It uses pickle underneath to serialize the data, so you can dump any python object through it.
        
        You can install it with
        ``pip install simplestreamer``
        
        Here is a quick example of how to use it. Hopefully it is self-explanatory enough.
        
        node 1 code: ::
        
            # just dumps time data into the streamer at 100 hz
            import simplestreamer
            import time
        
            streamer = simplestreamer.SimpleStreamer(5200)
        
            while True:
                streamer.send_data({"current time.time()": time.time()})
                time.sleep(0.01)
        
        
        node 2 (and 3, and 4, and so on) code: ::
        
            # subscribes to the stream from node 1 and periodically reads the data
            import simplestreamer
            import time
        
            streamer = simplestreamer.SimpleStreamer(5201)
            streamer.subscribe("127.0.0.1", 5200, "streamer 1")
            # You can optionally configure the rate at which the remote streamer sends you data
            #streamer.subscribe("127.0.0.1", 5200, "streamer 1", updates_per_sec=1.5)
        
            while True:
                print(streamer.get_data("streamer 1"))
                time.sleep(0.5)
