Library to read data from Bluetooth Smart sensors.

Features

1. Devices and sensor readings

   - SensorTag (CC2541DK, CC2650STK)

     - temperature
     - pressure
     - humidity
     - light (CC2541DK only)
     - accelerometer (CC2541DK only)

2. Sensor data access using `asyncio` coroutines.

Please update your sensor device to its latest firmware.

To use the library, run `bluetoothd` with `-E` option. Then as root::

    $ hciconfig hci0 up
    $ hcitool lescan
    $ hcitool lecc <MAC>

To extend SensorTag battery life::

    $ hcitool lecup  --handle=<HANDLE> --min 6 --max 100 --timeout 1000 --latency 0

Please note, that above command will make single sensor read to last about
250ms. Therefore reading 4 sensors will take about 1s.

The library provides `btzen` script to display sensor data::

    $ btzen <MAC>

Requirements

- bluez 5.36
- Python 3.5
- Python D-Bus bindings
