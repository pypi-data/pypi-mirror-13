Description: 
        RMA is a console tool to scan Redis key space in real time and aggregate memory usage statistic by key patterns. You may
        use this tools without maintenance on production servers. You can scanning by all or selected Redis types such as "string",
        "hash", "list", "set", "zset" and use matching pattern as you like. RMA try to discern key names by patterns, for example
        if you have keys like 'user:100' and 'user:101' application would pick out common pattern 'user:*' in output so you can
        analyze most memory distressed data in your instance.
