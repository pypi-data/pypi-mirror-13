# The main function to craft html code for each item. This is the only function that should be called directly besides
#       finalize_context_for_items().
# item_name is the name of the model in most cases. You could potentially have 2 of the same model on a page, however
#       this will currently requires you to have 2 sets of urls which is kind of dumb, but still possible.
# item_html_name is the name that will show up on the frontend to the users. This is also the name used on the modals.
# item_model is the class of the model. Be sure to send in the class, not the instance of the class.
# item_name_field_name is the name of the field that stores the name for this model. Example: You have a model called
#       Gender. It will have some kind of field to identify the gender by. This will likely be called "name", but
#       could be called anything so it is required to be able to identify the object on the frontend.
# field_list is the specially formatted list of fields and their info. For more information please refer to the
#       README.md file.
# name_of_app_with_urls is the name of the app that has the urls that will be used for performing all of the actions
#       from django_maced. Please note that url names should be named according to AppName.Action_ItemName. Example:
#       App name is component_manager and the item is component. The url names should be
#       "component_manager.add_component", "component_manager.edit_component", etc
# current_item_id is the id of the item that will be selected by default on the frontend when you first land on the
#       page. If you do not need one preselected, use 0. Since it can be tedious to get the current_item_id for each
#       object if you have several for a page, you can simply use the get_current_item_id(model_instance, field_name)
#       function. Just pass it your related model and the field name of the field that this item represents. Example:
#       You have a model called Person with an attribute called City but it is not a required field for this Person
#       object. You want City to be a django_maced item, but you don't want to have to check if city is there for this
#       person, because if it doesn't you won't be able to say person.city.id because id isn't on None. Of course, you
#       can do this manually, but if you have several of these, it could be annoying and the code will look cluttered.
#       Instead use get_current_item_id(person, "city") and it will do the work for you and raise errors appropriately.
#       If city isn't set for this person, it will return 0, which will result in the first select item to be
#       preselected (should be a blank entry in the select in this case since city isn't required).
# allow_empty simply sets whether or not a blank will be inserted into the select. This defaults to True. Set this to
#       False if you want this field to be required. One caveat is that if you don't have any instances of this model
#       in the system yet and you make it required, nothing will prevent it from allowing you to submit the form and
#       will have to be handled on the backend. Perhaps this can be changed in the future.
# field_to_order_by is the field to order your select by. It defaults to None which converts to item_name_field_name.
#       Note that you can add "-" in front of the field_to_order_by to make it descending order.
