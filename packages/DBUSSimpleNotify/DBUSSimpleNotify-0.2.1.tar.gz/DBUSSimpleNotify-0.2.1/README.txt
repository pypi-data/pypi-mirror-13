About
==================

DBUS Simple Notify is a fast to use function for printing out dbus notification, 
 should be fairly easy to extend and improve

dbussimplenotify.DBUSSimpleNotify.notify("my app", "hello world", 5000)

should print "hello world" comming from "my app" with a timeout on 5 sec
