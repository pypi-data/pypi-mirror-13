Framework for demonstrating the use of such for MPI applications.

The goal of this framework is to exploit the similarities between user-interface events and the receipt of MPI messages,
and to allow software applications to be developed that abstract the complexities of MPI while presenting a simple
interface to developers. This framework should be sufficient to demonstrate that the cost of development and maintenance
of MPI applications can be reduced.

I also created a C version of this project and successfully used it for several MPI applications that run on some
of the largest supercomputer clusters in the world. I recommend the creation of an open-source version of the same, and
this Python3 version is just to get the discussion going in the community.

There is a simple presentation of the idea on YouTube - search for it under Kiwi PyCon 2015.
