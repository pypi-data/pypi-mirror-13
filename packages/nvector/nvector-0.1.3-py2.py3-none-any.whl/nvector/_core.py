def get_north_pole_axis_for_E_frame(axis='z'):
    """
    Selects axes of the coordinate frame E.

    R_Ee controls the axes of the coordinate frame E (Earth-Centred,
    Earth-Fixed, ECEF) used by the other functions in this library

    There are two choices of E-axes that are described in Table 2 in Gade
    (2010):

    * e: z-axis points to the North Pole and
         x-axis points to the point where latitude = longitude = 0.
         This choice is very common in many fields.

    * E: x-axis points to the North Pole,
         y-axis points towards longitude +90deg (east) and latitude = 0.
         This choice of axis directions ensures that at zero latitude and
         longitude, N (North-East-Down) has the same orientation as E.
         If roll/pitch/yaw are zero, also B (Body, forward, starboard, down)
         has this orientation. In this manner, the axes of E is chosen to
         correspond with the axes of N and B.

    Based on this we get:
    R_Ee=[0 0 1
          0 1 0
         -1 0 0]

    The above R_Ee should be returned from this function when using z-axis to
    the North pole (which is most common). When using x-axis to the North
    pole, R_Ee should be set to I (identity matrix) (since the functions in
    this library are originally written for this option).
