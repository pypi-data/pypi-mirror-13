Description: pelican-provisioner
        ===================
        
        This package creates a working environment for a static blog that is generated by Pelican.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        ::
        
            mkvirtualenv pelican-provisioner
            pip install pelican-provisioner
        
        Create a blog
        -------------
        
        ::
        
            workon pelican-provisioner
            new-blog.sh ~/Work/my-blog
        
        Using the blog
        --------------
        
        ::
        
            workon my-blog
            cd ~/Work/my-blog
            make regenerate # to develop locally
            make serve # to test it locally at http://localhost:8000
            make deploy # to make the changes public
        
        Rationale
        ---------
        
        - I want a blog that is rock-solid.
        - When I sit down to do some writing, I don't want to spend any time on maintenance.
        - I want to leave the blog alone, come back to it after 1 year, I expect everything to work.
        - I want to install this from scratch without depending upon online packages.
        - I don't want future work to be contingent upon the any third party.
        
        To meet these goals, I am bundling everything; this is a self-contained static blog generator without any external dependencies.  I can create any number of blogs, which are managed as independent packages, and I can generally count upon them to keep working.
