pelican-provisioner
===================

This package creates a working environment for a static blog that is generated by Pelican.

Installation
------------

::

    mkvirtualenv pelican-provisioner
    pip install git+http://github.com/iandennismiller/pelican-provisioner.git

Create a blog
-------------

::

    workon pelican-provisioner
    new-blog.sh ~/Work/my-blog

Using the blog
--------------

::

    workon my-blog
    cd ~/Work/my-blog
    make regenerate # to develop locally
    make serve # to test it locally at http://localhost:8000
    make deploy # to make the changes public

Rationale
---------

- I want a blog that is rock-solid.
- When I sit down to do some writing, I don't want to spend any time on maintenance.
- I want to leave the blog alone, come back to it after 1 year, I expect everything to work.
- I want to install this from scratch without depending upon online packages.
- I don't want future work to be contingent upon the any third party.

To meet these goals, I am bundling everything; this is a self-contained static blog generator without any external dependencies.  I can create any number of blogs, which are managed as independent packages, and I can generally count upon them to keep working.
