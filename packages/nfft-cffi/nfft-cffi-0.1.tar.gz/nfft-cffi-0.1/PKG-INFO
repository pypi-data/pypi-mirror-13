Description: =========
        nfft-cffi
        =========
        
        Compute non-uniform fast Fourier transforms in Python.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        The following dependencies are required to build, run and test the package:
        
          - setuptools
          - pkgconfig
          - numpy
          - cffi
          - nose
        
        An installation of the NFFT library (version 3.3 or later) is also required. It should be discoverable with a call to pkg-config::
        
          $ pkg-config --libs nfft3
        
        Local or non-system installation locations are supported using PKG_CONFIG_PATH::
        
          $ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$HOME/local/lib/pkgconfig
          $ pkg-config --libs nfft3
        
        Using pip
        ---------
        
        The recommended way to install the package is via pip::
        
          $ pip install nfft-cffi
        
        Using setup.py 
        --------------
        
        This method is suitable for environments where pip is not available, or for testing modifications to the package::
        
          $ python setup.py install

        Guidelines
        ----------
        
        The development team welcomes feedback, code and enhancement proposals to the package from the community. Please consider opening an issue or submitting patches for inclusion to the code base via pull-request. For code contributions, please provide appropriate test cases for each new features and verify that the complete test suite runs successfully.
        
        Running the tests
        -----------------
        
        If the bindings were modified, then one should first rebuild the CFFI module with::
        
          $ python setup.py build_ext --inplace
        
        Before running the test suite with a call to::
        
          $ python setup.py nosetests
