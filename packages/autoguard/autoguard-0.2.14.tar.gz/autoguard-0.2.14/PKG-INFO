Description: autoguard
        =========
        
        The ``autoguard`` project is mostly a configuration setup for sentry.
        
        It provides a standardized, easily configurable setup for that project.
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        The ``autoguard`` configuration can be tuned in a few ways:
        
        * Specific environment variables (starting with ``AUTOGUARD_``)
        * Reading from ``/etc/autoguard/settings.ini``
        * On a dev checkout, reading from ``/path/to/autoguard_checkout/local_settings.ini``
        
        All options are described in ``example_settings.ini`` file.
        
        Security
        --------
        
        Autoguard expects to run behind a **HTTPS** reverse proxy; that proxy *MUST* set the ``X-Forwarded-Proto`` HTTP header
        to ``https`` for HTTPS requests.
        
        The authentication is based on ``X-auth-User`` HTTP header, the proxy *MUST* clean it before passing to the application.
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Run the following commands:
        
        .. code-block:: sh
        
            $ autoguard upgrade
            $ autoguard createsuperuser
            $ autoguard start
            $ autoguard celery worker -B
        
        The `autoguard` command is equivalent to `sentry --config=./autoguard/sentry_conf.py`.
