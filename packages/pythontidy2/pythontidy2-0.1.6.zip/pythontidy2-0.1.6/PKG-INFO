        pythontidy2
        ===========
        
        |Travis| |PyPI|
        
        Usage
        ~~~~~
        
        .. code:: python
        
            python -m pythontidy2 [-t expandtabsize] script.py
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        .. code:: python
        
            pip install pythontidy2
        
        Description
        -----------
        
        Life is short, format the code automatically
        
        (人生苦短，自动排版)
        
        Tidy python scripts
        
        Effect
        ------
        
        Convert Tabs to Spaces(Tabs sized can be decide in argument -t, default
        is 4)
        
        Delete white spaces at end of line
        
        Own thoughts about code format, some part are different from PEP8
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        PEP8: `Whitespace in Expressions and
        Statements <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#id23>`__ Not
        compliant
        
        Always add 1 white space between operators
        
        Align dict and assignment statments like following
        
        From:
        ~~~~~
        
        .. code:: python
        
            list = [1, 2, {
               'Alicedefg': '2341',
               'Beth' : "c",
               'Cecil' : '3258',
            }, 4]
        
        To:
        ~~~
        
        .. code:: python
        
            list = [1, 2, {
                            'Alicedefg' : '2341',
                            'Beth'      : "c",
                            'Cecil'     : '3258',
                            }, 4]
        
        From:
        ~~~~~
        
        .. code:: python
        
            doc = ""
            long_variable = ((doc+' ') if doc else '')
            x = ""
        
        To:
        ~~~
        
        .. code:: python
        
            doc           = ""
            long_variable = ((doc + ' ') if doc else '')
            x             = ""
        
        Limitation
        ----------
        
        Only Windows(\ *CRLF*) Linux/Modern OSX(\ *LF*) end of line mark
        supported
        
        Do not support classic Mac end of line mark(\ *CR*)
        
        Widechar(Asian) in sorce code (as variable or dict Key) not tested
        
        VIM Integration
        ---------------
        
        Below example binds the tidy fucntion to F7
        
        .. code:: vim
        
            command -range=% -nargs=* TidyPython <line1>,<line2>!python -m pythontidy2
            fun DoTidyPython()
                let Pos = line2byte( line( "." ) )
                :TidyPython
                exe "goto " . Pos
            endfun
            au Filetype python nmap <F7> :call DoTidyPython()<CR>
            au Filetype python imap <F7> <ESC>:call DoTidyPython()<CR>
            au Filetype python vmap <F7> :TidyPython<CR>
